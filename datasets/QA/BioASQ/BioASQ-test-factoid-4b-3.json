In spite of significant advances in the management of multiple myeloma (MM), the disease remains incurable and nearly all patients ultimately relapse and require salvage chemotherapy. As such, relapsed and relapsed-refractory MM remains a critical area of research pertaining to biological mechanisms of progression and chemotherapy resistance, as well as to the development of new pharmacologic agents and immunologic approaches for the disease. The immunomodulatory agents and proteasome inhibitors represent the cornerstone of treatment in this setting, with combination regimens incorporating these drugs demonstrating encouraging rates and duration of response, including the newer agents, pomalidomide and carfilzomib. In addition, novel drug classes have shown promising activity in RR MM, including the orally-administered proteasome inhibitors ixazomib and oprozomib; monoclonal antibodies such as the anti-CS1 monoclonal antibody elotuzumab and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab; and histone deacetylase inhibitors such as panobinostat and rocilinostat.",

Although Bortezomib has renovated the treatment of MM, a considerable proportion of subjects fail to respond to Bortezomib treatment and almost all patients relapse from this drug either alone or when used in combination therapies. However, the good clinical outcome of Bortezomib treatment in MM patients gave impulsion for the development of second generation proteasome inhibitors with the ambition of improving efficacy of proteasome inhibition, enhancing antitumor activity, and decreasing toxicity, as well as providing flexible dosing schedules and patient convenience. This review provides an overview of the role of oral proteasome inhibitors including Marizomib, Oprozomib, Delanzomib, chemical proteasome inhibitors, and cinnabaramides, in the therapy of MM, focusing on developments over the past five years. These emerging drugs with different mechanisms of action have exhibited promising antitumor activity in patients with relapsed/refractory MM, and they are creating chances to target multiple pathways, overcome resistance, and improve clinical outcomes, mainly for those subjects who are refractory to approved agents. Future steps in the clinical development of oral inhibitors include the optimization of the schedule and the definition of their antitumor activity in MM.",

Inhibition of proteasome, a proteolytic complex responsible for the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, has emerged as a powerful strategy for treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell malignancy. First-in-class agent, bortezomib, has demonstrated great positive therapeutic efficacy in MM, both in pre-clinical and in clinical studies. However, despite its high efficiency, a large proportion of patients do not achieve sufficient clinical response. Therefore, the development of a second-generation of proteasome inhibitors (PIs) with improved pharmacological properties was needed. Recently, several of these new agents have been introduced into clinics including carfilzomib, marizomib and ixazomib. Further, new orally administered second-generation PI oprozomib is being investigated.

Acquired resistance to proteasome inhibitors represents a considerable impediment to their effective clinical application. Carfilzomib and its orally bioavailable structural analog oprozomib are second-generation, highly-selective, proteasome inhibitors. However, the mechanisms of acquired resistance to carfilzomib and oprozomib are incompletely understood, and effective strategies for overcoming this resistance are needed. Here, we developed models of acquired resistance to carfilzomib in two head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, UMSCC-1 and Cal33, through gradual exposure to increasing drug concentrations. The resistant lines R-UMSCC-1 and R-Cal33 demonstrated 205- and 64-fold resistance, respectively, relative to the parental lines. Similarly, a high level of cross-resistance to oprozomib, as well as paclitaxel, was observed, whereas only moderate resistance to bortezomib (8- to 29-fold), and low level resistance to cisplatin (1.5- to 5-fold) was seen. Synergistic induction of apoptosis signaling and cell death, and inhibition of colony formation followed co-treatment of acquired resistance models with carfilzomib and the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) vorinostat. Synergism was also seen with other combinations, including oprozomib plus vorinostat, or carfilzomib plus the HDACi entinostat. Synergism was accompanied by upregulation of proapoptotic Bik, and suppression of Bik attenuated the synergy. The acquired resistance models also exhibited elevated levels of MDR-1/P-gp. Inhibition of MDR-1/P-gp with reversin 121 partially overcame carfilzomib resistance in R-UMSCC-1 and R-Cal33 cells. Collectively, these studies indicate that combining carfilzomib or oprozomib with HDAC or MDR-1/P-gp inhibitors may be a useful strategy for overcoming acquired resistance to these proteasome inhibitors.",

How amino acid levels are communicated to mTORC1 is only recently coming to light by the discovery of a lysosome-based signaling system composed of Rags (Ras-related GTPases) and Ragulator v-ATPase, GATOR (GAP activity towards Rags), and folliculin (FLCN) complexes.

The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase is a major regulator of cell growth that responds to numerous environmental cues.

GATOR2 is a complex of unknown function that positively regulates mTORC1 signaling by acting upstream of or in parallel to GATOR1, which is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RagA or RagB and an inhibitor of the amino-acid-sensing pathway. Here, we find that the Sestrins, a family of poorly understood growth regulators (Sestrin1-Sestrin3), interact with GATOR2 in an amino-acid-sensitive fashion. Sestrin2-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 signaling requires GATOR1 and the Rag GTPases, and the Sestrins regulate the localization of mTORC1 in response to amino acids. Thus, we identify the Sestrins as GATOR2-interacting proteins that regulate the amino-acid-sensing branch of the mTORC1 pathway.",

The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase is a master growth regulator that responds to multiple environmental cues. Amino acids stimulate, in a Rag-, Ragulator-, and vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase-dependent fashion, the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, where it interacts with its activator Rheb. Here, we identify SLC38A9, an uncharacterized protein with sequence similarity to amino acid transporters, as a lysosomal transmembrane protein that interacts with the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) and Ragulator in an amino acid-sensitive fashion. SLC38A9 transports arginine with a high Michaelis constant, and loss of SLC38A9 represses mTORC1 activation by amino acids, particularly arginine. Overexpression of SLC38A9 or just its Ragulator-binding domain makes mTORC1 signaling insensitive to amino acid starvation but not to Rag activity. Thus, SLC38A9 functions upstream of the Rag GTPases and is an excellent candidate for being an arginine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway.",

Heterodimeric Rag GTPases are required for amino-acid-mediated mTORC1 activation at the lysosome. However, the mechanism by which amino acids regulate Rag activation remains not fully understood. Here, we identified the lysosome-anchored E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF152 as an essential negative regulator of the mTORC1 pathway by targeting RagA for K63-linked ubiquitination. RNF152 interacts with and ubiquitinates RagA in an amino-acid-sensitive manner. The mutation of RagA ubiquitination sites abolishes this effect of RNF152 and enhances the RagA-mediated activation of mTORC1. Ubiquitination by RNF152 generates an anchor on RagA to recruit its inhibitor GATOR1, a GAP complex for Rag GTPases. RNF152 knockout results in the hyperactivation of mTORC1 and protects cells from amino-acid-starvation-induced autophagy. Thus, this study reveals a mechanism for regulation of mTORC1 signaling by RNF152-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination of RagA.",

CBA mice infected with 150 S. mansoni cercariae were treated with oxamniquine or praziquantel and dexamethasone or prednisolone. The rate of parasite egg excretion by treated mice and appropriate controls was monitored, and the mice were perfused 43 d after infection for estimation of worm burdens and tissue egg densities. Mice treated with schistosomicides alone or with schistosomicides plus steroids had worm burdens of similar size. Significant reductions in egg counts were, however, recorded in faeces, and in the intestines and livers (with consequent reduction in liver pathology), of mice treated with schistosomicide and steroid, when compared to mice treated with schistosomicide alone or steroid alone. The apparent inhibition of fecundity of S. mansoni by combining these drugs has clear implications for treatment of the Katayama syndrome.",

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the characteristics of imported Katayama fever (acute schistosomiasis) as well as evolution and outcome under treatment. METHODS: Between April 2000 and September 2004, we included prospectively all patients with confirmed diagnosis of Katayama fever. Follow-up was maintained at least until 6 months after symptoms resolved. Praziquantel (PZQ) was given as soon as the diagnosis was probable, most of the time with steroids. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were diagnosed with Katayama fever by Schistosoma egg detection and/or by seroconversion. Clinical features were non-specific, with mainly respiratory and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. Diagnosis was confirmed at presentation in 17/23 (74%) patients, of whom 15 by serology. Immediate clinical exacerbation occurred in five of nine patients not given steroids concomitantly with PZQ. After initial resolution, fever recurred in five (22%) patients. When compiling initial and recurrent episodes (n=28), respiratory symptoms tended to occur at an earlier stage after exposure, while abdominal complaints were more frequent later. All patients were completely cured, sometimes after repeated treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical presentation of Katayama fever is non-specific and involves respiratory and abdominal symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Katayama fever is an acute clinical condition characterised by high fever, dry cough and general malaise occurring during early Schistosoma spp. infection. It is predominantly reported in travellers from non-endemic regions. Whereas the immunological response to Schistosoma infection is well characterised, alterations in inflammatory markers and coagulation in response to acute infection are poorly understood. METHODS: Here we report the clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of three returning travellers with Katayama fever. Inflammatory markers and coagulation status were assessed repeatedly during follow-up to characterise the host response to infection. Radiographic findings were correlated with clinical and laboratory markers. RESULTS: Clinical symptoms were suggestive of a significant inflammatory response in all patients including high fever (>39\u00b0C), cough, and general malaise. Classical inflammatory markers including blood sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and serum amyloid A were only moderately elevated. Marked eosinophilia (33-42% of white blood cells) was observed and persisted despite anti-inflammatory and anthelminthic treatment for up to 32 weeks. Analysis of blood coagulation markers indicated increased coagulability reflected by elevated D-dimer values (0.57-1.17 \u03bcg/ml) and high thrombin generating potentials (peak thrombin activity: 311-384 nM). One patient showed particularly high levels of microparticle-associated tissue factor activity at initial presentation (1.64 pg/ml). Multiple pulmonary and hepatic opacities demonstrated by computed tomography (CT) scanning were associated with raised inflammatory markers in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: The characterisation of the inflammatory response, blood coagulation parameters and radiological findings in three patients adds to our current understanding of Katayama fever and serves as a starting point for further systematic investigations of the pathophysiology of this acute helminthic infection.",

Schistosomiasis is the second most common socio-economically devastating parasitic disease after malaria, affecting about 240 million residents of developing countries. In Africa, it predominantly manifests as urogenital disease, and the main infective agent is Schistosoma hematobium. Endemicity is propagated by poor socio-economic status and environmental degradation due to rapid urbanization. Recreational swimming is a potent medium for the spread of disease in children and adolescents. Most affected individuals are asymptomatic. The male and female worms are equipped with an extraordinary capacity for immune evasion and are able to co-habit for several decades within the pelvic venous plexus. Eggs deposited in the bladder wall resist elimination by type 1\u00a0T lymphocytes. Instead, they are sustained by pro-fibrogenic encapsulation (as modulated by type 2 helper cells). Progressive bladder disease results in obstructive uropathy and predisposes to (mostly) squamous cell carcinoma. Schistosomal glomerulopathy manifests as a clinical spectrum of asymptomatic proteinuria, nephrosis and/or nephritic syndrome. Findings on renal biopsy may be influenced by co-morbidity with Salmonella bacteria, amyloidosis and hepatitis C infection. Potentially fatal Katayama fever and spinal radiculopathy may ensue in tourists visiting an endemic zone. Early detection by urine microscopy is hampered by low urinary excretion rates of the parasite eggs. Although useful in travelers with newly acquired disease, the results of the serological antibody assay may be false positive in residents of an endemic zone. Cystoscopy, however, may be invaluable. Due to its safety, effectiveness and once-daily dosing, praziquantel is the drug of choice.

In early infections and in patients with only a few contacts with contaminated water, the total number of parasites, migrating larvae or schistosomulae, and adult worms, is very low. Eggs can only be found in faeces or urine when there is at least one pair of adult worms at the final location. The number of parasites increases as a function of the number of contacts with infected water. The exact latency between contamination and egg production is unknown. It is estimated that excretion of eggs starts after 40-50 days. The specific diagnosis of early schistosomiasis and Katayama fever relies essentially on serologic tests or preferably on PCR (if available). These assays are much more sensitive (up to four times) in the early phase of schistosomiasis than microscopic examination for typical eggs.

Glucose clearance in response to ip glucose tolerance test in obese APJ(\u0394islet) mice fed a chronic high-fat (HF) diet, but not pregnant APJ(\u0394islet) mice, was impaired significantly. In addition, the obesity-induced adaptive elevations in mean islet size and fractional islet area were reduced significantly in obese APJ(\u0394islet) mice when compared with wild-type mice. Together, these findings demonstrate a stimulatory role for the islet cell apelin-APJ signaling axis in regulation of pancreatic islet homeostasis and in metabolic induced \u03b2-cell hyperplasia. The results indicate the apelin-APJ system can be exploited for replenishment of BCM.",

The prevalence of obesity is increasing in both developed and developing countries. In the UK, for example, 60% of adults are overweight and 25% are obese. Obesity is associated with many pathological complications including respiratory, cardiovascular and endocrine, but it also affects fertility and is associated with many reproductive complications. This has led us and others to investigate links between women with high BMI, pregnancy outcome and uterine function. These studies in turn have led investigators to ask how obesity can have such an impact on reproduction and, as part of this, to consider the role of the adipokines released from adipose tissues. Our focus in this short review is on adipokines and myometrial activity, and for completeness we overview their effects on other smooth muscles. To date four adipokines (leptin, visfatin, apelin and ghrelin) have been investigated and all affect myometrial contractility, but some more potently than others. We consider the possible mechanisms involved in how adipokines may modify uterine contractility, and discuss the potential impact on labor and delivery.",

Infusion of high dose apelin-13 significantly suppressed LH release compared with the vehicle values at 30, 60 and 75 min (p<0.05). However, FSH levels did not significantly differ among the groups. Serum testosterone levels in high dose apelin-13 group were statistically lower than the control group (p<0.05). In addition, histological examination showed that infusion of high dose apelin-13 significantly decreased the number of Leydig cells compared with the control and lower dose apelin-13 groups (p<0.05, p<0.01).

Vaso-constrictive and vaso-dilatory molecules have been hypothesized to play a role in VOEs. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor that is released during VOEs and is correlated with pain history. Apelin is a vaso-dilatory peptide that also has a modulatory role in pain processing. We hypothesize that the ratio between vaso-dilatory and vaso-constrictive tone in children with SCD may be a marker of pain sensitization and vaso-occlusion. Plasma endothelin and apelin levels were measured in 47 children with SCD. Procedural pain and baseline pain were assessed via child- and caregiver-reports and observational distress. Pain history was assessed using retrospective chart review. Plasma apelin was related to age, with decreased levels in older children. The ratio between apelin and ET-1 was negatively correlated to observational baseline pain. The ratio between apelin and Big ET was negatively correlated to caregiver ratings of baseline pain and positively correlated to history of VOEs, which is possibly due to hydroxyurea treatment.

Our study aimed to investigate the potential protection mechanisms of apelin, with regard to primary rat retinal pericytes under hypoxia. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that pericytes colocalized with APJ in the fibrovascular membranes dissected from proliferative diabetic retinopathy patients. In the in vitro studies, we first demonstrated that the expression of apelin/APJ was upregulated in pericytes under hypoxia, and apelin increased pericytes proliferation and migration. Moreover, knockdown of apelin in pericyte was achieved via lentivirus-mediated RNA interference. After the inhibition of apelin, pericytes proliferation was inhibited significantly in hypoxia culture condition. Furthermore, exogenous recombinant apelin effectively prevented hypoxia-induced apoptosis through downregulating active-caspase 3 expression and increasing the ratio of B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) in pericytes. These results suggest that apelin suppressed hypoxia-induced pericytes injury, which indicated that apelin could be a potential therapeutic target for retinal angiogenic diseases.",

This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of natural apelin-12 (H-Arg-Pro-Arg-Leu-Ser-His-Lys-Gly-Pro-Met-Pro-Phe-OH, A12) and its novel structural analogs (H-(N(\u03b1)Me)Arg-Pro-Arg-Leu-Ser-His-Lys-Gly-Pro-Nle-Pro-Phe-OH, AI, and N(G)-Arg(N(G)NO2)-Pro-Arg-Leu-Ser-His-Lys-Gly-Pro-Nle-Pro-Phe-NH2, AII) as additives to crystalloid cardioplegia and explore benefits of early reperfusion with these peptides. METHODS: Isolated working rat hearts subjected to normothermic global ischemia and further reperfusion were used. St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution No.2 (STH2) containing 140 \u03bcM A12, AI, or AII was infused for 5 min at 25 \u00b0C before ischemia. In separate series, peptide administration was used for 5 min after ischemia. Metabolic state of the hearts was evaluated by myocardial content of high energy phosphates and lactate. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage was assessed in myocardial effluent on early reperfusion. RESULTS: Addition of the peptides to STH2 enhanced functional and metabolic recovery of reperfused hearts compared with those of control (STH2 without additives). Cardioplegia with analog AII was the most effective and accompanied by a reduction of postischemic LDH leakage. Infusion of A12, AI, or AII after ischemia improved the majority indices of cardiac function and metabolic state of the heart by the end of reperfusion. However, the overall protective effect of the peptides was less than when they were added to STH2. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancement of apelin bioavailability may minimize myocardial I/R damage during cardiac surgery. Structural analogs of A12 are promising components of clinical cardioplegic solutions.",

One of the latest examples comes from the study of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). As a member of the phakomatoses, TSC is characterized by the appearance of benign tumors, most notably in the central nervous system, kidney, heart, lung, and skin. While classically described as \"hamartomas,\" the pathology of the lesions has features suggestive of abnormal cellular proliferation, size, differentiation, and migration. Occasionally, tumors progress to become malignant (i.e., renal cell carcinoma). The genetic basis of this disease has been attributed to mutations in one of two unlinked genes, TSC1 and TSC2. Cells undergo bi-allelic inactivation of either gene to give rise to tumors in a classic tumor suppressor \"two-hit\" paradigm. The functions of the TSC1 and TSC2 gene products, hamartin and tuberin, respectively, have remained ill defined until recently. Genetic, biochemical, and biologic analyses have highlighted their role as negative regulators of the mTOR signaling pathway. Tuberin, serving as a substrate of AKT and AMPK, mediates mTOR activity by coordinating inputs from growth factors and energy availability in the control of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Emerging evidence also suggests that the TSC 1/2 complex may play a role in modulating the activity of beta-catenin and TGFbeta. These findings provide novel functional links between the TSC genes and other tumor suppressors responsible for Cowden's disease (PTEN), Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (LKB1), and familial polyposis (APC). Common sporadic cancers such as prostate, lung, colon, endometrium, and breast have ties to these genes, highlighting the potential role of the TSC proteins in human cancers. Rapamycin, a specific mTOR inhibitor, has potent antitumoral activities in preclinical models of TSC and is currently undergoing phase I/II clinical studies.",

BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of the RTS,S/AS01 candidate malaria vaccine during 18 months of follow-up have been published previously. Herein, we report the final results from the same trial, including the efficacy of a booster dose. METHODS: From March 27, 2009, until Jan 31, 2011, children (age 5-17 months) and young infants (age 6-12 weeks) were enrolled at 11 centres in seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) at first vaccination by block randomisation with minimisation by centre to receive three doses of RTS,S/AS01 at months 0, 1, and 2 and a booster dose at month 20 (R3R group); three doses of RTS,S/AS01 and a dose of comparator vaccine at month 20 (R3C group); or a comparator vaccine at months 0, 1, 2, and 20 (C3C [control group]). Participants were followed up until Jan 31, 2014. Cases of clinical and severe malaria were captured through passive case detection. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded. Analyses were by modified intention to treat and per protocol. The coprimary endpoints were the occurrence of malaria over 12 months after dose 3 in each age category. In this final analysis, we present data for the efficacy of the booster on the occurrence of malaria. Vaccine efficacy (VE) against clinical malaria was analysed by negative binomial regression and against severe malaria by relative risk reduction. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00866619. FINDINGS: 8922 children and 6537 young infants were included in the modified intention-to-treat analyses. Children were followed up for a median of 48 months (IQR 39-50) and young infants for 38 months (34-41) after dose 1. From month 0 until study end, compared with 9585 episodes of clinical malaria that met the primary case definition in children in the C3C group, 6616 episodes occurred in the R3R group (VE 36\u00b73%, 95% CI 31\u00b78-40\u00b75) and 7396 occurred in the R3C group (28\u00b73%, 23\u00b73-32\u00b79); compared with 171 children who experienced at least one episode of severe malaria in the C3C group, 116 children experienced at least one episode of severe malaria in the R3R group (32\u00b72%, 13\u00b77 to 46\u00b79) and 169 in the R3C group (1\u00b71%, -23\u00b70 to 20\u00b75). In young infants, compared with 6170 episodes of clinical malaria that met the primary case definition in the C3C group, 4993 episodes occurred in the R3R group (VE 25\u00b79%, 95% CI 19\u00b79-31\u00b75) and 5444 occurred in the R3C group (18\u00b73%, 11\u00b77-24\u00b74); and compared with 116 infants who experienced at least one episode of severe malaria in the C3C group, 96 infants experienced at least one episode of severe malaria in the R3R group (17\u00b73%, 95% CI -9\u00b74 to 37\u00b75) and 104 in the R3C group (10\u00b73%, -17\u00b79 to 31\u00b78). In children, 1774 cases of clinical malaria were averted per 1000 children (95% CI 1387-2186) in the R3R group and 1363 per 1000 children (995-1797) in the R3C group. The numbers of cases averted per 1000 young infants were 983 (95% CI 592-1337) in the R3R group and 558 (158-926) in the R3C group. The frequency of SAEs overall was balanced between groups. However, meningitis was reported as a SAE in 22 children: 11 in the R3R group, ten in the R3C group, and one in the C3C group. The incidence of generalised convulsive seizures within 7 days of RTS,S/AS01 booster was 2\u00b72 per 1000 doses in young infants and 2\u00b75 per 1000 doses in children. INTERPRETATION: RTS,S/AS01 prevented a substantial number of cases of clinical malaria over a 3-4 year period in young infants and children when administered with or without a booster dose. Efficacy was enhanced by the administration of a booster dose in both age categories. Thus, the vaccine has the potential to make a substantial contribution to malaria control when used in combination with other effective control measures, especially in areas of high transmission.

BACKGROUND: For regulatory approval, consistency in manufacturing of vaccine lots is expected to be demonstrated in confirmatory immunogenicity studies using two-sided equivalence trials. This randomized, double-blind study (NCT01323972) assessed consistency of three RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine batches formulated from commercial-scale purified antigen bulk lots in terms of anti-CS-responses induced. METHODS: Healthy children aged 5-17 months were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive RTS,S/AS01 at 0-1-2 months from one of three commercial-scale purified antigen bulk lots (1600 litres-fermentation scale; commercial-scale lots), or a comparator vaccine batch made from pilot-scale purified antigen bulk lot (20 litres-fermentation scale; pilot-scale lot). The co-primary objectives were to first demonstrate consistency of antibody responses against circumsporozoite (CS) protein at one month post-dose 3 for the three commercial-scale lots and second demonstrate non-inferiority of anti-CS antibody responses at one month post-dose 3 for the commercial-scale lots compared to the pilot-scale lot. Safety and reactogenicity were evaluated as secondary endpoints. RESULTS: One month post-dose-3, anti-CS antibody geometric mean titres (GMT) for the 3 commercial scale lots were 319.6 EU/ml (95% confidence interval (CI): 268.9-379.8), 241.4 EU/ml (207.6-280.7), and 302.3 EU/ml (259.4-352.3). Consistency for the RTS,S/AS01 commercial-scale lots was demonstrated as the two-sided 95% CI of the anti-CS antibody GMT ratio between each pair of lots was within the range of 0.5-2.0. GMT of the pooled commercial-scale lots (285.8 EU/ml (260.7-313.3)) was non-inferior to the pilot-scale lot (271.7 EU/ml (228.5-323.1)). Each RTS,S/AS01 lot had an acceptable tolerability profile, with infrequent reports of grade 3 solicited symptoms. No safety signals were identified and no serious adverse events were considered related to vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: RTS,S/AS01 lots formulated from commercial-scale purified antigen bulk batches induced a consistent anti-CS antibody response, and the anti-CS GMT of pooled commercial-scale lots was non-inferior to that of a lot formulated from a pilot-scale antigen bulk batch.",

Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the developing world. Until now, only one candidate malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01 has shown modest protection in phase 3 trial in African infants. Hence the treatment of malaria still depends on the current chemotherapeutic drugs. Considering the resistance of malaria parasites to almost all used antimalarial drugs, aiming at multi-targets rather than a single target will be a more promising strategy. Previous studies have shown that myricetin and fisetin exhibited in vitro antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum, but very little research focused on the molecular mechanism for their parasiticidal activity. The cysteine protease falcipain-2 and aspartic protease plasmepsin II have long been considered as important antimalarial drug targets, especially combined inhibition of these two proteases. In this study, we determined that myricetin and fisetin are dual inhibitors of falcipain-2 and plasmepsin II, which might account for their antimalarial properties. Overall, the dual inhibition of falcipain-2 and plasmepsin II by myricetin and fisetin has shed light on a possible mechanism for their antimalarial activity and provided a rationale for further development as antimalarial drugs.",

Abstract  Autoimmune regulator (Aire) is one of the most well-characterized molecules in autoimmunity, but its function outside the immune system is largely unknown. The recent discovery of Aire expression in stem cells and early embryonic cells and its function in the self-renewal of embryonic stem (ES) cells highlight the importance of Aire in these cells. In this study, we present evidence that Aire promotes the expression of the pluripotent factor Lin28 and the self-renewal of ES cells. We presented the first evidence that the let-7 microRNA family contributed to the self-renewal promoting effect of Aire on ES cells. Moreover, we showed that Aire and Lin28 are co-expressed in the genital ridge, oocytes, and cleavage-stage embryos, and the expression level of Lin28 is correlated with the expression level of Aire. Although it is widely considered to be a promiscuous gene expression activator, these results indicated that Aire promotes the self-renewal of ES cells through a specific pathway (i.e., the activation of Lin28 and the inhibition of the let-7 microRNA family). The correlation between Aire and Lin28 expression in germ cells and early embryos indicated an in vivo function for Aire in toti- and pluripotent stem cells. This study presents the first molecular pathway that incorporates Aire into the pluripotency network. Moreover, it presents the first evidence that microRNAs contribute to the regulatory function of Aire and highlights a novel function of Aire in stem cell biology and reproduction. These functions reveal novel perspectives for studying the molecular mechanisms behind the establishment and sustenance of pluripotent identity.",

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are emerging as a promising immunotherapeutic, based largely on their overt suppression of T lymphocytes under inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. While paracrine cross-talk between MSCs and T cells has been well-studied, an intrinsic transcriptional switch that programs MSCs for immunomodulation has remained undefined. Here we show that bone marrow-derived MSCs require the transcriptional regulator Aire to suppress T cell-mediated pathogenesis in a mouse model of chronic colitis. Surprisingly, Aire did not control MSC suppression of T cell proliferation in vitro. Instead, Aire reduced T cell mitochondrial reductase by negatively regulating a proinflammatory cytokine, early T cell activation factor (Eta)-1. Neutralization of Eta-1 enabled Aire(-/-) MSCs to ameliorate colitis, reducing the number of infiltrating effector T cells in the colon, and normalizing T cell reductase levels. We propose that Aire represents an early molecular switch imposing a suppressive MSC phenotype via regulation of Eta-1. Monitoring Aire expression in MSCs may thus be a critical parameter for clinical use.",

It has been well recognized that ESC genomes are maintained in a globally transcriptional hyperactive state, which genetically poised ESCs to the high differentiation potential. However, the transcription factors regulating the global transcription activities in ESCs are not well defined. We show here that mouse and human ESCs express two transcription factors, Aire and Deaf1. Previously known to function in the thymus stromal cells and peripheral lymphoid organs respectively, Aire and Deaf1 help regulate the ectopic expression of diverse tissue-specific antigens to establish self-immune tolerance. Differentiation of ESCs greatly reduced Aire and Deaf1 expression, in a pattern similar to the pluripotent factors, Oct4 and Nanog. Knockdown of Aire in mouse ESCs resulted in significantly decreased clone-forming efficiency as well as attenuated cell cycle, suggesting Aire plays a role in ESC self-renewal. In addition, some differentiation-associated genes that are sporadically expressed in ESCs were reduced in expression upon Aire knockdown. These results suggest that transcription factors such as Aire and Deaf1, which exert global transcriptional regulatory functions, may play important roles in self-renewal of ESCs and maintaining ESC in a transcriptionally hyperactive state.",

RATIONALE: The structural and functional integrity of the endothelium is crucial in maintaining vascular homeostasis and preventing atherosclerosis. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have an increased risk of developing endothelial dysfunction and premature cardiovascular disease. Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation is increased in SLE and has been proposed to contribute to endothelial damage, but the mechanism remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine the mechanism by which enhanced NET formation by low-density granulocytes (LDGs) in SLE contributes to endothelial damage and disrupts the endothelium. RESULTS: The putative role of NET-externalised matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in altering the functional integrity of the endothelium was examined. MMP-9 externalised by lupus LDGs during NET formation specifically impaired murine aortic endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and induced endothelial cell apoptosis. Endothelial dysfunction correlated with the activation of endothelial MMP-2 by MMP-9 present in NETs, while inhibition of MMP-2 activation restored endothelium-dependent function and decreased NET-induced vascular cytotoxicity. Moreover, immunogenic complexes composed of MMP-9 and anti-MMP-9 were identified in SLE sera. These complexes, as well as anti-MMP-9 autoantibodies, induced NETosis and enhanced MMP-9 activity. CONCLUSIONS: These observations implicate activation of endothelial MMP-2 by MMP-9 contained in NETs as an important player in endothelial dysfunction, and MMP-9 as a novel self-antigen in SLE. These results further support that aberrant NET formation plays pathogenic roles in SLE.",

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 277 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class (FC) II-IV CHF were examined.

A control group included 136 patients (mean age 53.6 \u00b1 4.8 years) with no signs of cardiovascular diseases, as evidenced by the examination. RESULTS: The frequency of the 5A allele and the 5A/5A genotype of the 1171 5A/6A polymorphic locus in the MMP-3 gene proved to be higher in the patients with CHF than that in the control group. Thus, the variability of the 5A allele (odds ratio (OR), 1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.033 to 1.869; p = 0.03) and the 5A/5A genotype (OR, 2.15; 95% CI: 1.131 to 4.070; p = 0.02) was associated with increased risk for CHF.

Extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of endopeptydases which recquire a zinc ion at their active site, for proteolityc activity. There are six members of the MMP family: matrilysins, collagenases, stromelysins, gelatinases, membrane MMPs and other MMPs. Activity of MMPs is regulated at the level of gene transcription, mRNA stability, zymogene proteolitic activation, inhibition of an active enzyme and MMP degradation. Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are main intracellular inhibitors of MMPs. Host cells can be stimulated by tumor cells to produce MMPs by secreted interleukins, interferons, growth factors and an extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN). MMPs are produced by tumor cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, mast cells, polimorphonuclear neutrophiles (PMNs) and endothelial cells (ECs). MMPs affect many stages of tumor development, facilitating its growth through promoting tumor cells proliferation, invasion and migration, new blood vessels formation and blocking tumor cells apoptosis. MMPs can promote tumor development in several ways. ECM degradation results in release of peptide growth factors. Growth factors linked with cell surface or binding proteins can also be liberated by MMPs. MMPs can indirectly regulate integrin signalling or cleave E-cadherins, facilitating cell migration. MMPs support metastasis inducing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). MMP also support transendothelial migration. MMPs support angiogenesis by releasing pro-angiogenic factors and degrading ECM to support ECs migration. Cell surface growth factor receptors are also cleaved by MMPs, which results in inhibition of tumor development, so is release of anti-angiogenic factors from ECM.",

Also, the increased sophistication and resolution of cryo-electron microscopy techniques, combined with high-resolution structural studies on a smaller scale, promise to create detailed images of the global structure of the spliceosome and its main components, which in turn will provide a plethora of mechanistic insights.

Not much is known about the organization of splicing machinery and mechanisms in human malaria parasite. Present study reports the organization and assembly of Plasmodium spliceosome Sm core complex. METHODS: Presence of all the seven Plasmodium Sm-like proteins in the intra-erythrocytic stages was assessed based on the protein(s) expression analysis using immuno-localization and western blotting. Localization/co-localization studies were performed by immunofluorescence analysis on thin parasite smear using laser scanning confocal microscope. Interaction studies were carried out using yeast two-hybrid analysis and validated by in vitro pull-down assays. PfPRMT5 (arginine methyl transferase) and PfSmD1 interaction analysis was performed by pull-down assays and the interacting proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF spectrometry. RESULTS: PfSm proteins are expressed at asexual blood stages of the parasite and show nucleo-cytoplasmic localization. Protein-protein interaction studies showed that PfSm proteins form a heptameric complex, typical of spliceosome core complex as shown in humans. Interaction of PfSMN (survival of motor neuron, tudor domain containing protein) or PfTu-TSN (Tudor domain of Tudor Staphylococcal nuclease) with PfSmD1 proteins was found to be methylation dependent. Co-localization by immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation studies suggested an association between PfPRMT5 and PfSmD1, indicating the role of arginine methylation in assembly of Plasmodium spliceosome complex. CONCLUSIONS: Plasmodium Sm-like proteins form a heptameric ring-like structure, although the arrangement of PfSm proteins slightly differs from human splicing machinery. The data shows the interaction of PfSMN with PfSmD1 and this interaction is found to be methylation dependent. PfPRMT5 probably exists as a part of methylosome complex that may function in the cytoplasmic assembly of Sm proteins at asexual blood stages of P. falciparum.",

Spliceosomes are macro-complexes involving hundreds of proteins with many functional interactions. Spliceosome assembly belongs to the key processes that enable splicing of mRNA and modulate alternative splicing. A detailed list of factors involved in spliceosomal reactions has been assorted over the past decade, but, their functional interplay is often unknown and most of the present biological models cover only parts of the complete assembly process. It is a challenging task to build a computational model that integrates dispersed knowledge and combines a multitude of reaction schemes proposed earlier.Because for most reactions involved in spliceosome assembly kinetic parameters are not available, we propose a discrete modeling using Petri nets, through which we are enabled to get insights into the system's behavior via computation of structural and dynamic properties. In this paper, we compile and examine reactions from experimental reports that contribute to a functional spliceosome. All these reactions form a network, which describes the inventory and conditions necessary to perform the splicing process. The analysis is mainly based on system invariants. Transition invariants (T-invariants) can be interpreted as signaling routes through the network. Due to the huge number of T-invariants that arise with increasing network size and complexity, maximal common transition sets (MCTS) and T-clusters were used for further analysis. Additionally, we introduce a false color map representation, which allows a quick survey of network modules and the visual detection of single reactions or reaction sequences, which participate in more than one signaling route. We designed a structured model of spliceosome assembly, which combines the demands on a platform that i) can display involved factors and concurrent processes, ii) offers the possibility to run computational methods for knowledge extraction, and iii) is successively extendable as new insights into spliceosome function are reported by experimental reports. The network consists of 161 transitions (reactions) and 140 places (reactants). All reactions are part of at least one of the 71 T-invariants. These T-invariants define pathways, which are in good agreement with the current knowledge and known hypotheses on reaction sequences during spliceosome assembly, hence contributing to a functional spliceosome. We demonstrate that present knowledge, in particular of the initial part of the assembly process, describes parallelism and interaction of signaling routes, which indicate functional redundancy and reflect the dependency of spliceosome assembly initiation on different cellular conditions. The complexity of the network is further increased by two switches, which introduce alternative routes during A-complex formation in early spliceosome assembly and upon transition from the B-complex to the C-complex. By compiling known reactions into a complete network, the combinatorial nature of invariant computation leads to pathways that have previously not been described as connected routes, although their constituents were known. T-clusters divide the network into modules, which we interpret as building blocks in spliceosome maturation. We conclude that Petri net representations of large biological networks and system invariants, are well-suited as a means for validating the integration of experimental knowledge into a consistent model. Based on this network model, the design of further experiments is facilitated.",

BACKGROUND: Since its isolation in 1970, and discovery of its potent inhibitory activity on T-cell proliferation, cyclosporin A (CsA) has been shown to play a significant role in diverse fields of biology. Furthermore, chemical modification of CsA has led to analogs with distinct biological activities associated with its protein receptor family, cyclophilins. SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review systematically collates the synthetic chemistry performed at each of the eleven amino acids, and provides examples of the utility of such transformations. The various modifications of CsA are traced from early, modest chemistry performed at the unique Bmt residue, through the remarkable use of a polyanion enolate that can be stereoselectively manipulated, and onto application of more recently developed olefin metathesis chemistry to prepare new CsA derivatives with unexpected biological activity. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: The myriad biological activities of CsA and its synthetic derivatives have inspired the development of new approaches to modify the CsA ring. In turn, these new CsA derivatives have served as tools in the discovery of new roles for cyclophilins. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This review provides information on the types of cyclosporin derivatives that are available to the many biologists working in this field, and should be of value to the medicinal chemist trying to discover drugs based on CsA.

Cyclosporin A, a cyclic peptide, has found widespread clinical use in the prevention of graft rejection following bone marrow and organ transplantation. The mechanisms of immunosuppression mediated by FK506 and CsA appear to be remarkably similar, suggesting that these unrelated structures act on a common receptor or on similar molecular targets, perhaps the CsA receptor, cyclophilin, which has recently been shown by Fischer et al. and Takahashi et al. to have cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity.

Cyclosporine mediates its immunosuppressive effect by preventing the synthesis of lymphokine mRNA during the process of T lymphocyte activation. Although the detailed molecular mechanism by which CsA achieves this effect is unknown, two proteins have been identified as putative intracellular CsA-receptor proteins. One of these, calmodulin, is an important Ca++-binding protein and enzyme cofactor and the other, cyclophilin, is a novel protein that is reported to have protein kinase activity. In this study the CsA-binding capacity of both these proteins has been assessed using CsA-coated ELISA plates and CsA-affinity gel matrices. CsA binding was shown by cyclophilin whereas no CsA-calmodulin binding could be detected under identical conditions. However, it was not possible to demonstrate any cyclophilin-associated protein kinase activity. Jurkat cells were probed for the presence of CsA-binding proteins using the CsA-affinity gel matrix; a 17 KD protein, most probably cyclophilin, was identified as the major CsA-binding protein. In addition, a previously unidentified CsA-binding 45 KD phosphoprotein was precipitated from 32P-labeled Jurkat cells. These results would support cyclophilin as the major, if not only, intracellular receptor protein for CsA. However, the relationship between binding of CsA to cyclophilin and/or the 45 KD phosphoprotein and the immunosuppressive effects of CsA is still unknown.",

BACKGROUND: High-occupancy target (HOT) regions are compact genome loci occupied by many different transcription factors (TFs). HOT regions were initially defined in invertebrate model organisms, and we here show that they are a ubiquitous feature of the human gene-regulation landscape. RESULTS: We identified HOT regions by a comprehensive analysis of ChIP-seq data from 96 DNA-associated proteins in 5 human cell lines. Most HOT regions co-localize with RNA polymerase II binding sites, but many are not near the promoters of annotated genes. At HOT promoters, TF occupancy is strongly predictive of transcription preinitiation complex recruitment and moderately predictive of initiating Pol II recruitment, but only weakly predictive of elongating Pol II and RNA transcript abundance. TF occupancy varies quantitatively within human HOT regions; we used this variation to discover novel associations between TFs. The sequence motif associated with any given TF's direct DNA binding is somewhat predictive of its empirical occupancy, but a great deal of occupancy occurs at sites without the TF's motif, implying indirect recruitment by another TF whose motif is present. CONCLUSIONS: Mammalian HOT regions are regulatory hubs that integrate the signals from diverse regulatory pathways to quantitatively tune the promoter for RNA polymerase II recruitment.",

Functional impairment of the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex underlies deficits in executive control that characterize addictive disorders, including alcohol addiction. Previous studies indicate that alcohol alters glutamate neurotransmission and one substrate of these effects may be through the reconfiguration of the subunits constituting ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) complexes. Glutamatergic transmission is integral to cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical communication and alcohol-induced changes in the abundance of the receptor subunits and/or their splice variants may result in critical functional impairments of prefrontal cortex in alcohol dependence. To this end, the effects of chronic ethanol self-administration on glutamate receptor ionotropic AMPA (GRIA) subunit variant and kainate (GRIK) subunit mRNA expression were studied in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of male cynomolgus monkeys. In DLPFC, total AMPA splice variant expression and total kainate receptor subunit expression were significantly decreased in alcohol drinking monkeys. Expression levels of GRIA3 flip and flop and GRIA4 flop mRNAs in this region were positively correlated with daily ethanol intake and blood ethanol concentrations (BEC) averaged over the 6 months prior to necropsy. In OFC, AMPA subunit splice variant expression was reduced in the alcohol treated group. GRIA2 flop mRNA levels in this region were positively correlated with daily ethanol intake and BEC averaged over the 6 months prior to necropsy. Results from these studies provide further evidence of transcriptional regulation of iGluR subunits in the primate brain following chronic alcohol self-administration. Additional studies examining the cellular localization of such effects in the framework of primate prefrontal cortical circuitry are warranted.",

A growing body of evidence suggests an association between microdeletion/microduplication and schizophrenia/intellectual disability. Abnormal neurogenesis and neurotransmission have been implicated in the pathogenesis of these neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. The kainate/AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptor (GRIK = glutamate receptor, ionotropic, kainate) plays a critical role in synaptic potentiation, which is an essential process for learning and memory. Among the five known GRIK family members, haploinsufficiency of GRIK1, GRIK2, and GRIK4 are known to cause developmental delay, whereas the roles of GRIK3 and GRIK5 remain unknown. Herein, we report on a girl who presented with a severe developmental delay predominantly affecting her language and fine motor skills. She had a 2.6-Mb microdeletion in 1p34.3 involving GRIK3, which encodes a principal subunit of the kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptor. Given its strong expression pattern in the central nervous system and the biological function of GRIK3 in presynaptic neurotransmission, the haploinsufficiency of GRIK3 is likely to be responsible for the severe developmental delay in the proposita. A review of genetic alterations and the phenotypic effects of all the GRIK family members support this hypothesis. The current observation of a microdeletion involving GRIK3, a kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit, and the neurodevelopmental manifestation in the absence of major dysmorphism provides further clinical implication of the possible role of GRIK family glutamate receptors in the pathogenesis of developmental delay.",

PURPOSE: Programmed death 1 is an immune checkpoint that suppresses antitumor immunity. Nivolumab, a fully human immunoglobulin G4 programmed death 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, was active and generally well tolerated in patients with advanced solid tumors treated in a phase I trial with expansion cohorts. We report overall survival (OS), response durability, and long-term safety in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving nivolumab in this trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (N = 129) with heavily pretreated advanced NSCLC received nivolumab 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg intravenously once every 2 weeks in 8-week cycles for up to 96 weeks. Tumor burden was assessed by RECIST (version 1.0) after each cycle. RESULTS: Median OS across doses was 9.9 months; 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 42%, 24%, and 18%, respectively, across doses and 56%, 42%, and 27%, respectively, at the 3-mg/kg dose (n = 37) chosen for further clinical development. Among 22 patients (17%) with objective responses, estimated median response duration was 17.0 months. An additional six patients (5%) had unconventional immune-pattern responses. Response rates were similar in squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC. Eighteen responding patients discontinued nivolumab for reasons other than progressive disease; nine (50%) of those had responses lasting > 9 months after their last dose. Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 14% of patients. Three treatment-related deaths (2% of patients) occurred, each associated with pneumonitis. CONCLUSION: Nivolumab monotherapy produced durable responses and encouraging survival rates in patients with heavily pretreated NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Nivolumab (a programmed death 1 [PD-1] checkpoint inhibitor) and ipilimumab (a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 [CTLA-4] checkpoint inhibitor) have been shown to have complementary activity in metastatic melanoma. In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study, nivolumab alone or nivolumab plus ipilimumab was compared with ipilimumab alone in patients with metastatic melanoma. METHODS: We assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, 945 previously untreated patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma to nivolumab alone, nivolumab plus ipilimumab, or ipilimumab alone. Progression-free survival and overall survival were coprimary end points. Results regarding progression-free survival are presented here. RESULTS: The median progression-free survival was 11.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.9 to 16.7) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab, as compared with 2.9 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 3.4) with ipilimumab (hazard ratio for death or disease progression, 0.42; 99.5% CI, 0.31 to 0.57; P<0.001), and 6.9 months (95% CI, 4.3 to 9.5) with nivolumab (hazard ratio for the comparison with ipilimumab, 0.57; 99.5% CI, 0.43 to 0.76; P<0.001). In patients with tumors positive for the PD-1 ligand (PD-L1), the median progression-free survival was 14.0 months in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and in the nivolumab group, but in patients with PD-L1-negative tumors, progression-free survival was longer with the combination therapy than with nivolumab alone (11.2 months [95% CI, 8.0 to not reached] vs. 5.3 months [95% CI, 2.8 to 7.1]). Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 16.3% of the patients in the nivolumab group, 55.0% of those in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group, and 27.3% of those in the ipilimumab group.

METHODS: We randomly assigned 272 patients to receive nivolumab, at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks, or docetaxel, at a dose of 75 mg per square meter of body-surface area every 3 weeks. The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: The median overall survival was 9.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.3 to 13.3) with nivolumab versus 6.0 months (95% CI, 5.1 to 7.3) with docetaxel.

Specific secondary structures of this region play an important role in viroid replication and processing. Viroids of the Avsunviroidae family lack a CCR but possess self-cleaving properties by forming hammerhead ribozyme structures; they accumulate and replicate in chloroplasts, whereas members of the Pospiviroidae family have a nuclear localization.

On the basis of sequence homology a model is proposed for five structural and functional domains in viroids.

That the evolution of viroids has involved RNA rearrangements of domains is supported by the partial duplication of coconut cadang cadang viroid, which arises de novo during each infection. Similar RNA rearrangements have been established for animal viral defective interfering RNAs, which arise by some form of discontinuous transcription. This mechanism could account for the origin of viroids and also RNA viruses, whereby modules of genetic information may have undergone repeated exchange between RNA pathogens and the RNA of their hosts.",

Intriguingly, viroids have evolved the ability to replicate in two cellular organella, the nucleus (family Pospiviroidae) and the chloroplast (family Avsunviroidae). Viroid replication proceeds through an RNA-based rolling-circle mechanism with three steps that, with some variations, operate in both polarity strands: i) synthesis of longer-than-unit strands catalyzed by either the nuclear RNA polymerase II or a nuclear-encoded chloroplastic RNA polymerase, in both instances redirected to transcribe RNA templates, ii) cleavage to unit-length, which in the family Avsunviroidae is mediated by hammerhead ribozymes embedded in both polarity strands, while in the family Pospiviroidae the oligomeric RNAs provide the proper conformation but not the catalytic activity, and iii) circularization. The host RNA polymerases, most likely assisted by additional host proteins, start transcription from specific sites, thus implying the existence of viroid promoters. Cleavage and ligation in the family Pospiviroidae is probably catalyzed by an RNase III-like enzyme and an RNA ligase able to circularize the resulting 5' and 3' termini.

Infected plants appear to contain only multimeric linear (-)strand RNAs, and attempts to initiate infection with multimeric (-)PSTVd RNAs generally have failed. To examine critically the infectivity of monomeric (-)strand viroid RNAs, we have developed a ribozyme-based expression system for the production of precisely full length (-)strand RNAs whose termini are capable of undergoing facile circularization in vitro. Mechanical inoculation of tomato seedlings with electrophoretically purified (-)PSTVd RNA led to a small fraction of plants becoming infected whereas parallel assays with an analogous tomato planta macho viroid (-)RNA resulted in a much larger fraction of infected plants. Ribozyme-mediated production of (-)PSTVd RNA in transgenic plants led to the appearance of monomeric circular (-)PSTVd RNA and large amounts of (+)PSTVd progeny. No monomeric circular (-)PSTVd RNA could be detected in naturally infected plants by using either ribonuclease protection or electrophoresis under partially denaturing conditions.

The fidelity of protein synthesis depends on the capacity of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) to couple only cognate amino acid-tRNA pairs. If amino acid selectivity is compromised, fidelity can be ensured by an inherent AARS editing activity that hydrolyses mischarged tRNAs. Here, we show that the editing activity of Escherichia coli leucyl-tRNA synthetase (EcLeuRS) is not required to prevent incorrect isoleucine incorporation. Rather, as shown by kinetic, structural and in vivo approaches, the prime biological function of LeuRS editing is to prevent mis-incorporation of the non-standard amino acid norvaline. This conclusion follows from a reassessment of the discriminatory power of LeuRS against isoleucine and the demonstration that a LeuRS editing-deficient E. coli strain grows normally in high concentrations of isoleucine but not under oxygen deprivation conditions when norvaline accumulates to substantial levels. Thus, AARS-based translational quality control is a key feature for bacterial adaptive response to oxygen deprivation. The non-essential role for editing under normal bacterial growth has important implications for the development of resistance to antimicrobial agents targeting the LeuRS editing site.",

Activity-dependent modifications of excitatory synapses contribute to synaptic maturation and plasticity, and are critical for learning and memory. Consequently, impairments in synapse formation or synaptic transmission are thought to be responsible for several types of mental disabilities. BRAG1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTP-binding protein Arf6 that localizes to the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. Mutations in BRAG1 have been identified in families with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). These mutations mapped to either the catalytic domain or an IQ-like motif; however, the pathophysiological basis of these mutations remains unknown. Here, we show that the BRAG1 IQ motif binds apo-calmodulin (CaM), and that calcium-induced CaM release triggers a reversible conformational change in human BRAG1. We demonstrate that BRAG1 activity, stimulated by activation of NMDA-sensitive glutamate receptors, depresses AMPA receptor (AMPA-R)-mediated transmission via JNK-mediated synaptic removal of GluA1-containing AMPA-Rs in rat hippocampal neurons. Importantly, a BRAG1 mutant that fails to activate Arf6 also fails to depress AMPA-R signaling, indicating that Arf6 activity is necessary for this process. Conversely, a mutation in the BRAG1 IQ-like motif that impairs CaM binding results in hyperactivation of Arf6 signaling and constitutive depression of AMPA transmission. Our findings reveal a role for BRAG1 in response to neuronal activity with possible clinical relevance to nonsyndromic XLID.",

INTRODUCTION: Stanford type A aortic dissection is a rare phenomenon with high short-term mortality and clinical manifestations that can make differential diagnosis a lengthy process requiring several diagnostic examinations. OBJECTIVES: Based on a case report, the aim is to highlight the importance of physical examination in the initial management of these patients and of rapid access to a surgical center. A brief review follows on the diagnosis and treatment of ascending aortic dissection, and its specific nature in Marfan syndrome. CASE REPORT: A 33-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department of a district hospital with chest and back pain associated with vomiting, 20 hours after symptom onset. Initial physical examination revealed an aortic systolic murmur and musculoskeletal morphological abnormalities compatible with Marfan syndrome. Given suspected aortic dissection, a transthoracic echocardiogram was immediately performed, which showed an extensive intimal flap originating at the sinotubular junction. He was transferred to the cardiothoracic surgery department of a referral hospital where he was treated by a Bentall procedure. CONCLUSION: In this case, careful physical examination during initial assessment raised the suspicion that this patient was in a high-risk group for aortic dissection, thus avoiding unnecessary and lengthy exams. This diagnosis requires emergent surgical treatment, and so direct contact in real time between those making in the diagnosis and the surgeon is essential, as well as protocols governing immediate access to a surgical center.",

CONTEXT: Meningeal abnormalities such as dural ectasia are seen in Marfan syndrome, but spinal meningeal cysts are rarely seen. These cysts usually asymptomatic and often found incidentally on magnetic resonance imaging, large cysts may cause neurological deficits and pain secondary to nerve root compression. DESIGN: Case reports. FINDINGS: Two patients with Marfan syndrome presented with urinary symptoms secondary to dural ectasia and sacral cysts. Patient 1 had a history of low back pain, erectile dysfunction, and occasional urinary incontinence and groin pain with recent symptom worsening. He underwent L5 partial laminectomy and S1-S2 laminectomy with sacral cyst decompression. Nine weeks later, he underwent drainage of a sacral pseudomeningocele. Pain and urinary symptoms resolved, and he remains neurologically normal 2 years after surgery. Patient 2 presented after a fall on his tailbone, complaining of low back pain and difficulty urinating. Physical therapy was implemented, but after 4 weeks, urinary retention had not improved. He then underwent resection of the sacral cyst and S1-S3 laminectomy. Pain and paresthesias resolved and bowel function returned to normal. Other than needing intermittent self-catheterization, all other neurologic findings were normal 30 months after surgery. CONCLUSION/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Surgical goals for sacral cysts include resection as well as closure of the dura, which can be challenging due to thinning from ectasia. Neurosurgical intervention in Marfan syndrome is associated with a high risk of dural tears and osseous complications, and should be performed only when symptoms are severe.",

Patients who have the Marfan syndrome should have serial echocardiograms to measure aortic root diameter carefully at the sinuses of Valsalva and subsequent levels (sinotubular junction, arch, descending and abdominal aorta). Additionally, color Doppler echocardiography assists in the diagnosis of aortic dissection and facilitates evaluation of the severity of aortic and mitral regurgitation that commonly complicate the Marfan syndrome. The risk of aortic dissection, which is the most serious manifestation of the Marfan syndrome, increases as the aorta enlarges. Therefore, elective composite graft surgery is recommended when the aortic root size reaches 60 mm, regardless of symptom status, or 55 mm in the presence of severe aortic regurgitation.

INTRODUCTION: Marfan syndrome is a multisystemic connective tissue disorder caused mainly by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene. The entire cardiovascular system is affected in patients with Marfan syndrome. Aortic root dilatation, aortic valve regurgitation or - the most feared and life-threatening symptom - aortic root dissection are the most common manifestations. Therapeutic strategies, such as prophylactic aortic root surgery and pharmacological therapy, focus on the prevention of aortic dissection. Currently, the standard medicinal treatments targeting aortic dilatation and dissection consist of agents generally used to lower blood pressure and/or the inotropic state of the heart. By these means, the cyclic repetitive forces exerted on the aortic wall are diminished and thus the onset of aortic dilatation is potentially prevented. Although these pharmacological agents may offer some benefit in reduction of aortic aneurysm expansion rate, they do not target the underlying cause of the progressive aortic degradation. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the effectiveness of frequently prescribed medications used to prevent and delay aortic complications in Marfan syndrome. New insights on the biochemical pathways leading to aortic disease are also discussed to highlight new targets for pharmacological therapy. EXPERT OPINION: Recent insights in the transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway and inflammatory mechanisms in a well-established mouse model of Marfan syndrome, have led to studies exploring new pharmacological treatment strategies with doxycycline, statins and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Pharmacological therapy is focused more on prevention than on delay of aortic wall pathology in Marfan syndrome. Of the new pharmacological treatment strategies targeting aortic pathology in Marfan syndrome, angiotensin receptor type 1 blockers are promising candidates, with several clinical trials currently ongoing.",

METHODS: From May 2008 to December 2012, 500 patients were screened at the Marfan Presidium of the Tor Vergata University Hospital of Rome (Italy). Patients were evaluated by a cardiac surgeon, including echocardiographic, orthopedic, ophthalmologic and dental examinations. All patients received genetic counseling, and genetic sampling was performed if appropriate. RESULTS: The diagnosis of Marfan syndrome was confirmed in 146 patients (29.2%). Fifty-four patients (37%) underwent cardiac surgery on the aortic root, 4 patients had surgery on the mitral valve, 13 patients had combined surgery; 11 cases were emergent surgery for acute aortic dissection. Twenty-eight patients (52%) were operated on at our Division: 13 underwent valve-sparing aortic root replacement (David procedure), 1 underwent Yacoub remodeling procedure and 14 underwent Bentall procedure. Following the establishment of the Marfan Center, the David aortic valve-sparing operation was the most frequently performed procedure compared to the previous period of surgical activity (63 vs 22%, p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Regular follow-up twice a year may allow to identify patients at risk for acute aortic syndromes.

A small number of reports of rare, attenuated forms of CHS exist, with affected individuals exhibiting progressive neurodegenerative disease beginning in early adulthood with cognitive decline, parkinsonism, features of spinocerebellar degeneration, and peripheral neuropathy, as well as subtle pigmentary abnormalities and subclinical or absent immune dysfunction. METHODS: In a consanguineous Pakistani kindred with clinical phenotypes consistent with attenuated CHS, we performed SNP array-based homozygosity mapping and whole gene sequencing of LYST. RESULTS: We identified three individuals homozygous for a novel six base pair in-frame deletion in LYST (c.9827_9832ATACAA), predicting the loss of asparagine and threonine residues from the LYST transcript (p.Asn3276_Thr3277del), and segregating with the phenotype in this family. CONCLUSIONS: We further characterize the neurologic features of the attenuated form of CHS, and discuss pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the neurodegenerative components of CHS.

BACKGROUND: Majeed syndrome is an autosomal recessive, autoinflammatory disorder characterised by chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis and congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia. The objectives of this study were to map, identify, and characterise the Majeed syndrome causal gene and to speculate on its function and role in skin and bone inflammation. METHODS: Six individuals with Majeed syndrome from two unrelated families were identified for this study. Homozygosity mapping and parametric linkage analysis were employed for the localisation of the gene responsible for Majeed syndrome. Direct sequencing was utilised for the identification of mutations within the genes contained in the region of linkage. Expression studies and in silico characterisation of the identified causal gene and its protein were carried out. RESULTS: The phenotype of Majeed syndrome includes inflammation of the bone and skin, recurrent fevers, and dyserythropoietic anaemia. The clinical picture of the six affected individuals is briefly reviewed. The gene was mapped to a 5.5 cM interval (1.8 Mb) on chromosome 18p. Examination of genes in this interval led to the identification of homozygous mutations in LPIN2 in affected individuals from the two families. LPIN2 was found to be expressed in almost all tissues. The function of LPIN2 and its role in inflammation remains unknown. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that homozygous mutations in LPIN2 result in Majeed syndrome. Understanding the aberrant immune response in this condition will shed light on the aetiology of other inflammatory disorders of multifactorial aetiology including isolated chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, Sweet syndrome, and psoriasis.",

          "context": "Biofoams and natural protein surfactants. Naturally occurring foam constituent and surfactant proteins with intriguing structures and functions are now being identified from a variety of biological sources. The ranaspumins from tropical frog foam nests comprise a range of proteins with a mixture of surfactant, carbohydrate binding and antimicrobial activities that together provide a stable, biocompatible, protective foam environment for developing eggs and embryos. Ranasmurfin, a blue protein from a different species of frog, displays a novel structure with a unique chromophoric crosslink. Latherin, primarily from horse sweat, but with similarities to salivary, oral and upper respiratory tract proteins, illustrates several potential roles for surfactant proteins in mammalian systems. These proteins, together with the previously discovered hydrophobins of fungi, throw new light on biomolecular processes at air-water and other interfaces. This review provides a perspective on these recent findings, focussing on structure and biophysical properties.",

Ranasmurfin, a previously uncharacterized approximately 13 kDa blue protein found in the nests of the frog Polypedates leucomystax, has been purified and crystallized. The crystals are an intense blue colour and diffract to 1.51 A with P2(1) symmetry and unit-cell parameters a = 40.9, b = 59.9, c = 45.0 A, beta = 93.3 degrees . Self-rotation function analysis indicates the presence of a dimer in the asymmetric unit. Biochemical data suggest that the blue colour of the protein is related to dimer formation. Sequence data for the protein are incomplete, but thus far have identified no model for molecular replacement. A fluorescence scan shows a peak at 9.676 keV, indicating that the protein binds zinc and suggesting a route for structure solution.",
