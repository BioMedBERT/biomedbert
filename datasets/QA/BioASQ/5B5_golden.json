The trained classifier is used to identify novel miRNA gene candidates located within cancer-associated genomic regions and rank the resulting predictions using expression information from a full genome tiling array. Finally, four of the top scoring predictions are verified experimentally using northern blot analysis. Our work combines both analytical and experimental techniques to show that SSCprofiler is a highly accurate tool which can be used to identify novel miRNA gene candidates in the human genome.
