Here, we integrate genome-wide data on TF-binding sites, chromatin markers and functional annotations to predict genes associated with human eQTLs. Using the random forest classifier, we found that genomic proximity plus five TF and chromatin features are able to predict >90% of target genes within 1 megabase of eQTLs. Despite being regularly used to map target genes, proximity is not a good indicator of eQTL targets for genes 150 kilobases away, but insulators, TF co-occurrence, open chromatin and functional similarities between TFs and genes are better indicators. Using all six features in the classifier achieved an area under the specificity and sensitivity curve of 0.91, much better compared with at most 0.75 for using any single feature. We hope this study will not only provide validation of eQTL-mapping studies, but also provide insight into the molecular mechanisms explaining how genetic variation can influence gene expression.",

Manta can discover and score variants based on supporting paired and split-read evidence, with scoring models optimized for germline analysis of diploid individuals and somatic analysis of tumor-normal sample pairs. Call quality is similar to or better than comparable methods, as determined by pedigree consistency of germline calls and comparison of somatic calls to COSMIC database variants.

Manta is optimized for rapid germline and somatic analysis, calling structural variants, medium-sized indels and large insertions on standard compute hardware in less than a tenth of the time that comparable methods require to identify only subsets of these variant types: for example NA12878 at 50\u00d7 genomic coverage is analyzed in less than 20\u2009min. Manta can discover and score variants based on supporting paired and split-read evidence, with scoring models optimized for germline analysis of diploid individuals and somatic analysis of tumor-normal sample pairs. Call quality is similar to or better than comparable methods, as determined by pedigree consistency of germline calls and comparison of somatic calls to COSMIC database variants. Manta consistently assembles a higher fraction of its calls to base-pair resolution, allowing for improved downstream annotation and analysis of clinical significance. We provide Manta as a community resource to facilitate practical and routine structural variant analysis in clinical and research sequencing scenarios.",

Insulating domains in Rap1p coincide with previously described transcription activation domains, whereas four adjacent subdomains spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display autonomous insulating capacity. That both Rap1p and Abf1p silencing domains either contain or largely overlap with an insulating domain suggests that insulation conveys some undefined chromosome organization capacity that also contributes a function in silencing.

Our method combines call sets derived by multiple pipelines from arbitrary numbers of datasets and interpolates expected concordance for genomic regions without data. By applying RG to 219 deep human WGS datasets, we demonstrate that VC concordance depends predominantly on genomic context rather than the actual sequencing data which manifests in high recurrence of regions that can/cannot be reliably genotyped by a single method. This enables the application of pre-computed regions to other data created with comparable sequencing technology and software.",

Among adults, the sensitivity of this test varies on the basis of disease severity (spectrum bias). A similar phenomenon may occur when this test is used in a pediatric population, which may affect the need for culture confirmation of all negative RADT results.To assess the performance of a clinical scoring system and to determine whether RADT spectrum bias is present among children who are evaluated for GABHS pharyngitis.Laboratory and clinical records for a consecutive series of pediatric patients who underwent RADT at the Marshfield Clinic between January 2002 and March 2002 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were stratified according to the number of clinical features present by using modified Centor criteria, ie, history of fever, absence of cough, presence of pharyngeal exudates, and cervical lymphadenopathy. The sensitivity of the RADT was defined as the number of patients with positive RADT results divided by the number of patients with either positive RADT results or negative RADT results but positive throat culture results.RADT results were positive for 117 of 561 children (21%), and culture results were positive for 35 of 444 children (8%) with negative RADT results. The overall prevalence of GABHS pharyngitis was 27% (95% confidence interval: 23-31%). The prevalence of GABHS pharyngitis was 18% among patients with 0 Centor criteria, 16% among those with 1 criterion, 32% among those with 2 criteria, and 50% among those with 3 or 4 criteria.

We wanted to evaluate the correlation between Centor criteria and presence of GABHS in children with sore throat admitted to our paediatric emergency department (PED).Retrospective cohort study.The emergency department of a large tertiary university hospital in Brussels, with over 20 000 yearly visits for children below age 16.All medical records (from 2008 to 2010) of children between ages 2 and 16, who were diagnosed with pharyngitis, tonsillitis or sore throat and having a throat swab culture for GABHS. Children with underlying chronic respiratory, cardiac, haematological or immunological diseases and children who had already received antibiotics (AB) prior to the PED consult were excluded. Only records with a full disease history were selected. Out of a total 2118 visits for sore throats, 441 met our criteria. The children were divided into two age groups, 2-5 and 5-16 years.The prevalence of GABHS was higher in the older children compared to the preschoolers (38.7 vs 27.6; p=0.01), and the overall prevalence was 32%. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of GABHS for all different Centor scores within an age group. Likelihood ratios (LR) demonstrate that none of the individual symptoms or a Centor score of \u22653 seems to be effective in ruling in or ruling out GABHS. Pooled LR (CI) for Centor \u22653 was 0.67 (CI 0.50 to 0.90) for the preschoolers and 1.37 (CI 1.04 to 1.79) for the older children.Our results confirm the ineffectiveness of Centor criteria as a predicting factor for finding GABHS in a throat swab culture in children.",

In diagnosis, Centor clinical scoring system or rapid antigen test can be helpful in targeting antibiotic use. The Centor scoring system can help to identify those patients who have higher likelihood of group A streptococcal infection. In patients with high likelihood of streptococcal infections (e.g. 3-4 Centor criteria) physicians can consider the use of rapid antigen test (RAT). If RAT is performed, throat culture is not necessary after a negative RAT for the diagnosis of group A streptococci. To treat sore throat, either ibuprofen or paracetamol are recommended for relief of acute sore throat symptoms. Zinc gluconate is not recommended to be used in sore throat. There is inconsistent evidence of herbal treatments and acupuncture as treatments for sore throat. Antibiotics should not be used in patients with less severe presentation of sore throat, e.g. 0-2 Centor criteria to relieve symptoms. Modest benefits of antibiotics, which have been observed in patients with 3-4 Centor criteria, have to be weighed against side effects, the effect of antibiotics on microbiota, increased antibacterial resistance, medicalisation and costs. The prevention of suppurative complications is not a specific indication for antibiotic therapy in sore throat. If antibiotics are indicated, penicillin V, twice or three times daily for 10 days is recommended. At the present, there is no evidence enough that indicates shorter treatment length.",

          "text": "the regulatory interactions between auxin response factors arfs and aux iaa repressors play a central role in auxin signal transduction yet the systems properties of this regulatory network are not well established we generated a steroid inducible arf5 monopteros mp transgenic background to survey the involvement of this factor in the transcriptional regulation of the entire aux iaa family in arabidopsis thaliana target genes of arf5 mp identified by this approach were confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation in vitro gel retardation assays and gene expression analyses our study shows that arf5 mp is indispensable for the correct regulation of nearly one half of all aux iaa genes and that these targets coincide with distinct subclades further genetic analyses demonstrate that the protein products of multiple aux iaa targets negatively feed back onto arf5 mp activity this work indicates that arf5 mp broadly influences the expression of the aux iaa gene family and suggests that such regulation involves the activation of specific subsets of redundantly functioning factors these groups of factors may then act together to control various processes within the plant through negative feedback on arf5 similar detailed analyses of other aux iaa arf regulatory modules will be required to fully understand how auxin signal transduction influences virtually every aspect of plant growth and development.",

          "text": "a well known physiological adaptation process of plants encountering drying soil is to achieve water balance by reducing shoot growth and maintaining or promoting root elongation but little is known about the molecular basis of this process this study investigated the role of a drought up regulated triticum aestivum nac69 1 tanac69 1 in the modulation of root growth in wheat tanac69 1 was predominantly expressed in wheat roots at the early vegetative stage overexpression of tanac69 1 in wheat roots using osrsp3 essentially root specific and ospip2 3 root predominant promoters resulted in enhanced primary seminal root length and a marked increase in maturity root biomass competitive growth analysis under water limited conditions showed that osrsp3 promoter driven tanac69 1 transgenic lines produced 32 and 35 more above ground biomass and grains than wild type plants respectively tanac69 1 overexpression in the roots down regulated the expression of tashy2 and taiaa7 which are from the auxin iaa aux iaa transcriptional repressor gene family and are the homologs of negative root growth regulators shy2 iaa3 and iaa7 in arabidopsis the expression of tashy2 and taiaa7 in roots was down regulated by drought stress and up regulated by cytokinin treatment which inhibited root growth dna binding and transient expression analyses revealed that tanac69 1 bound to the promoters of tashy2 and taiaa7 acted as a transcriptional repressor and repressed the expression of reporter genes driven by the tashy2 or taiaa7 promoter these data suggest that tanac69 1 is a transcriptional repressor of tashy2 and taiaa7 homologous to arabidopsis negative root growth regulators and is likely to be involved in promoting root elongation in drying soil.",
