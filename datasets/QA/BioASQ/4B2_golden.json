Here, we address this issue by exploring genome-wide profiles of 24 histone modifications in two distinct human cell types, embryonic stem cells and lung fibroblasts. We developed a Random-Forest based algorithm, RFECS (Random Forest based Enhancer identification from Chromatin States) to integrate histone modification profiles for identification of enhancers, and used it to identify enhancers in a number of cell-types. We show that RFECS not only leads to more accurate and precise prediction of enhancers than previous methods, but also helps identify the most informative and robust set of three chromatin marks for enhancer prediction.", "beginSection": "abstract", "document": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23526891", "endSection": "abstract"}]}, {"body": "When ceritinib used instead of crizotinib?", "documents": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26366094", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25258420", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25945060"], "ideal_answer": ["Ceritinib is approved for the treatment of ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC patients that are crizotinib-resistant and crizotinib-na\u00efve."], "exact_answer": [["crizotinib-resistant ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC patients"], ["crizotinib-na\u00efve ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC patients"]], "type": "list", "id": "56d042ae3975bb303a00000d", "snippets": [{"offsetInBeginSection": 840, "offsetInEndSection": 1010, "text": "Ceritinib is a second-generation ALK inhibitor that has demonstrated activity in crizotinib-resistant patients, becoming a promising treatment option in this population.
