          "context": "emMAW: computing minimal absent words in external memory. Motivation: The biological significance of minimal absent words has been investigated in genomes of organisms from all domains of life. For instance, three minimal absent words of the human genome were found in Ebola virus genomes. There exists an O(n) -time and O(n) -space algorithm for computing all minimal absent words of a sequence of length n on a fixed-sized alphabet based on suffix arrays. A standard implementation of this algorithm, when applied to a large sequence of length n , requires more than 20 n \u00a0bytes of RAM. Such memory requirements are a significant hurdle to the computation of minimal absent words in large datasets. Results: We present emMAW, the first external-memory algorithm for computing minimal absent words. A free open-source implementation of our algorithm is made available. This allows for computation of minimal absent words on far bigger data sets than was previously possible. Our implementation requires less than 3 h on a standard workstation to process the full human genome when as little as 1 GB of RAM is made available. We stress that our implementation, despite making use of external memory, is fast; indeed, even on relatively smaller datasets when enough RAM is available to hold all necessary data structures, it is less than two times slower than state-of-the-art internal-memory implementations.

OBJECTIVE: A frequent complication of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is recurrent disease. The aim of this study was to determine whether early recurrence risk was higher after infection with ribotype 027 (outbreak strain) compared with infection with endemic strain types of C.\u00a0difficile. METHODS: Consecutive patients diagnosed with CDI between May 2013 and March 2014 were included (outbreak strain, and non-outbreak strains). Patients who developed recurrent CDI within 30\u00a0days after completion of CDI treatment, were compared with patients without a recurrence. Medical charts were reviewed for demographic and clinical characteristics. General practitioners were contacted to complete data about the occurrence of recurrent CDI, and the use of medication after hospital discharge. RESULTS: In total, 135 patients were at risk for the development of recurrent CDI; 74 patients were infected by ribotype 027, and 61 patients by other ribotypes. Thirty-nine patients (29%) developed recurrent CDI within 30\u00a0days after completion of CDI treatment. In multivariable analysis, age > 70\u00a0years (HR 3.05, 95% CI 1.54-6.03), and a duration of CDI treatment > 11\u00a0days (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.00-3.69) were clearly associated with recurrence; infection with ribotype 027 showed a HR of 1.72 (95% CI 0.88-3.33). CONCLUSION: During this outbreak of C.\u00a0difficile in a tertiary care centre, age and a prolonged duration of CDI therapy (which is most likely a marker of underlying disease severity) were the main risk factors for recurrent CDI. This points to host factors as more important predictors for recurrent CDI than strain type or antibiotic use.",

BACKGROUND: An outbreak of Clostridium difficile ribotype 027 infection (CDI) occurred at an university hospital, involving 19 departments. To determine what hospital-associated factors drove the outbreak of this particular strain we performed a case-control study. METHODS: Cases (n = 79), diagnosed with CDI due to C. difficile ribotype 027 were matched for age and treating medical specialty to four control patients (n = 316). Patients diagnosed with CDI due to other ribotypes were included as a second control group. A random selection of C. difficile ribotype 027 strains (n = 10) was genotyped by Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). FINDINGS: WGS showed the outbreak was likely caused by a single strain of C. difficile (two or less single-nucleotide variants between isolates). Ninety-five percent of cases had used antibiotics, compared to 56% of controls. Previous admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) (OR: 2.4, 95% CI 1.0-5.6), longer length of stay (LOS), and recent hospital admission were associated with CDI ribotype 027. Cases were less likely to have been admitted to a ward with a known isolated CDI patient (OR: 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.6). Analysis of patients who stayed at the ICU (35 cases; 51 controls), indicated that the use of selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) and a longer LOS in the ICU were associated with CDI risk. INTERPRETATION: In this large outbreak, any antibiotic use, including SDD use, appeared as a prerequisite for acquisition of the outbreak strain. The role of use of SDD and prolonged stay on the ICU could not be disentangled, but both factors can play a biologically plausible role in C. difficile acquisition and infection.",

Epidemiology of Clostridium difficile is characterized by worldwide increase of C. difficile infections (CDI) and the emergence of new epidemic outbreak strains with the capacity for global spreading. Long-term local surveillance at the University of Saarland Medical Center between 2000 and 2013 shows that the incidence rate of laboratory-confirmed CDI was influenced by local epidemiology as well as by testing strategies. Since 2008, molecular typing of C. difficile was regularly performed for symptomatic hospitalized patients by surface-layer protein A sequence typing (slpAST), which is an established highly standardized technique for genotyping of C. difficile. The results were assigned to known ribotypes for better comparison to international data. It could be demonstrated that distribution of genotypes was different between age groups. Older patients were predominantly infected with ribotype 001 and 027, whereas ribotype 027 was not detected in the pediatric population. Molecular typing of German isolates sent to the advisory laboratory between 2011 and 2013 revealed that ribotype 027 is present with high percentages in most German regions except for the very North. In conclusion, optimized testing of all hospitalized patients with diarrhea should be generally implemented to avoid under-diagnosis of C. difficile infection. Ribotype 027 is highly prevalent in Germany, but its infections are restricted to older patients, while absent in children. Molecular typing of suspected hospital outbreaks and of patients with severe or recurrent disease may help to better understand virulence and epidemic spreading of C. difficile.",

OBJECTIVE Estimating the risk of a complicated course of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) might help doctors guide treatment. We aimed to validate 3 published prediction models: Hensgens (2014), Na (2015), and Welfare (2011). METHODS The validation cohort comprised 148 patients diagnosed with CDI between May 2013 and March 2014. During this period, 70 endemic cases of CDI occurred as well as 78 cases of CDI related to an outbreak of C. difficile ribotype 027. Model calibration and discrimination were assessed for the 3 prediction rules. RESULTS A complicated course (ie, death, colectomy, or ICU admission due to CDI) was observed in 31 patients (21%), and 23 patients (16%) died within 30 days of CDI diagnosis. The performance of all 3 prediction models was poor when applied to the total validation cohort with an estimated area under the curve (AUC) of 0.68 for the Hensgens model, 0.54 for the Na model, and 0.61 for the Welfare model. For those patients diagnosed with CDI due to non-outbreak strains, the prediction model developed by Hensgens performed the best, with an AUC of 0.78. CONCLUSION All 3 prediction models performed poorly when using our total cohort, which included CDI cases from an outbreak as well as endemic cases. The prediction model of Hensgens performed relatively well for patients diagnosed with CDI due to non-outbreak strains, and this model may be useful in endemic settings.

An outbreak of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) caused by ribotype 027 (B1/NAP1) began in our hospital in November 2014, and produced 141 episodes in the following months. The aim of this study is to describe this outbreak, assess risk factors for recurrence of CDI-027 and to analyze the implementation of a novel treatment strategy. This is a prospective study of all patients with CDI-027, from November 2014 to November 2015. The epidemiological data were collected daily for each patient. We compared clinical characteristics and treatment between patients with and without recurrence of CDI-027. Interestingly, liver cirrhosis was present in 22% of the patients, and most of them received prophylaxis for hepatic encephalopathy with rifaximin. Patients were also taking antimicrobial drugs (93.6%) and proton pump inhibitors (80.1%). Overall, 27 (23.5%) patients had a first recurrence of CDI-027. Liver cirrhosis increased the risk of recurrence (44.4% vs 14.8%). Patients treated with a prolonged oral vancomycin regimen vs the conventional regimen (oral metronidazole or 10\u00a0days of vancomycin) had fewer recurrences (8.6 versus 44.7% [p\u00a0 < \u00a00.01]; OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.028-0.294) and less attributable mortality (0% versus 7.1%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.058). We report an outbreak of CDI-027, mainly in patients with liver cirrhosis. Recurrence of CDI-027 was more common in those patients. A novel approach involving high-dose prolonged vancomycin taper as a first-line treatment, together with a bundle of outbreak measures, seemed to reduce the number of cases of CDI-027, recurrences, and attributable mortality. Nevertheless, this approach warrants further investigation.",

BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of Clostridium difficile NAP1/BI/027 (C. difficile 027) has become one of the leading threats of healthcare-associated infections worldwide. However, C. difficile 027 infections have been rarely reported in Asia, particularly in China. RESULTS: In this study, we identified a rare C. difficile bloodstream infection (BSI) from three isolates of a patient during repeated hospital admission. This finding triggered a retrospective epidemiological study to scan all cases and strains emerged from this ward during the past three years. Using medical personnel interviews, medical record reviews and the genomic epidemiology, two outbreaks in 2012 and 2013-2014 were identified. Through using whole genome sequencing, we succeeded to trace the origin of the BSI strain. Surprisingly, we found the genome sequences were similar to C. difficile 027 strain R20291, indicating the occurrence of a rare C. difficile 027 strain in China. Integrated epidemiological investigation and whole genome sequencing of all strains, we constructed a nosocomial transmission map of these two C. difficile 027 outbreaks and traced the origin of the infection. CONCLUSIONS: By genome sequencing, spatio-temporal analysis and field epidemiology investigation, we can estimate their complex transform network and reveal the possible modes of transmission in this ward. Based on their genetic diversity, we can assume that the toilets, bathroom, and janitor's equipment room may be contaminated area, which may be suggested to improve infection control measures in the following health care.",

The primary aim of this study was to provide insight into the financial burden that this CDI outbreak brought upon this hospital. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed to estimate the costs of a one-year-long C.\u00a0difficile ribotype 027 outbreak. Medical charts were reviewed for patient data. In addition, all costs associated with the outbreak control measures were collected. FINDINGS: The attributable costs of the whole outbreak were estimated to be \u20ac1,222,376. The main contributing factor was missed revenue due to increased length of stay of CDI patients and closure of beds to enable contact isolation of CDI patients (36%). A second important cost component was extra surveillance and activities of the Department of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control (25%). CONCLUSION: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to provide insight into the attributable costs of CDI in an outbreak setting, and to delineate the major cost items. It is clear that the economic consequences of CDI are significant. The high costs associated with a CDI outbreak should help to justify the use of additional resources for CDI prevention and control.",

The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe normally has haploid cells of two mating types, which differ at the chromosomal locus mat1. After two consecutive asymmetric cell divisions, only one in four 'grand-daughter' cells undergoes a 'mating-type switch', in which genetic information is transferred to mat1 from the mat2-P or mat3-M donor loci. This switching pattern probably results from an imprinting event at mat1 that marks one sister chromatid in a strand-specific manner, and is related to a site-specific, double-stranded DNA break at mat1. Here we show that the genetic imprint is a strand-specific, alkali-labile DNA modification at mat1. The DNA break is an artefact, created from the imprint during DNA purification. We also propose and test the model that mat1 is preferentially replicated by a centromere-distal origin(s), so that the strand-specific imprint occurs only during lagging-strand synthesis. Altering the origin of replication, by inverting mat1 or introducing an origin of replication, affects the imprinting and switching efficiencies in predicted ways. Two-dimensional gel analysis confirmed that mat1 is preferentially replicated by a centromere-distal origin(s).

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, origins of replication (autonomously replicating sequences; ARSs), centromeres, and telomeres have been isolated and characterized. The identification of these structures allows the construction of artificial chromosomes in which the architecture of eukaryotic chromosomes may be studied. A common feature of most, and possibly all, natural yeast chromosomes is that they have an ARS within 2 kilobases of their physical ends. To study the effects of such telomeric ARSs on chromosome maintenance, we introduced artificial chromosomes of approximately 15 and 60 kilobases into yeast cells and analyzed the requirements for telomeric ARSs and the effects of ARS-free chromosomal arms on the stability of these molecules. We find that terminal blocks of telomeric repeats are sufficient to be recognized as telomeres. Moreover, artificial chromosomes containing telomere-associated Y' sequences and telomeric ARSs were no more stable during both mitosis and meiosis than artificial chromosomes lacking terminal ARSs, indicating that yeast-specific blocks of telomeric sequences are the only cis-acting requirement for a functional telomere during both mitotic growth and meiosis.

Although the block to chromosome segregation has been thought to occur by inhibiting anaphase, we show checkpoint-defective rad53 mutants undergo cycles of spindle extension and collapse after hydroxyurea treatment that are distinct from anaphase cells. Furthermore, chromatid cohesion, whose dissolution triggers anaphase, is dispensable for S phase checkpoint arrest. Kinetochore-spindle attachments are required to prevent spindle extension during replication blocks, and chromosomes with two centromeres or an origin of replication juxtaposed to a centromere rescue the rad53 checkpoint defect. These observations suggest that checkpoint signaling is required to generate an inward force involved in maintaining preanaphase spindle integrity during DNA replication distress. We propose that by promoting replication fork integrity under these conditions Rad53 ensures centromere duplication.

Moreover, mutations in these LCS genes also increased the loss rate of an authentic linear yeast chromosome, chromosome III, but had only small effects on the loss rate of a circular derivative of chromosome III. As these mutants preferentially destabilize linear chromosomes, they may affect chromosome stability through interactions at telomeres. Telomeres are thought to be essential for the protection and complete replication of chromosome ends. The cytological properties of telomeres suggest that these structures may play additional roles in chromosome function. The lengths of the terminal C1-3A repeats at the ends of yeast chromosomes were unaltered in the linear preferential lcs mutants, suggesting that these mutants do not affect the replication or protection of telomeric DNA.

Eukaryotic centromeres are maintained at specific chromosomal sites over many generations. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, centromeres are genetic elements defined by a DNA sequence that is both necessary and sufficient for function; whereas, in most other eukaryotes, centromeres are maintained by poorly characterized epigenetic mechanisms in which DNA has a less definitive role. Here we use the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans as a model organism to study the DNA replication properties of centromeric DNA. By determining the genome-wide replication timing program of the C. albicans genome, we discovered that each centromere is associated with a replication origin that is the first to fire on its respective chromosome. Importantly, epigenetic formation of new ectopic centromeres (neocentromeres) was accompanied by shifts in replication timing, such that a neocentromere became the first to replicate and became associated with origin recognition complex (ORC) components. Furthermore, changing the level of the centromere-specific histone H3 isoform led to a concomitant change in levels of ORC association with centromere regions, further supporting the idea that centromere proteins determine origin activity. Finally, analysis of centromere-associated DNA revealed a replication-dependent sequence pattern characteristic of constitutively active replication origins. This strand-biased pattern is conserved, together with centromere position, among related strains and species, in a manner independent of primary DNA sequence. Thus, inheritance of centromere position is correlated with a constitutively active origin of replication that fires at a distinct early time. We suggest a model in which the distinct timing of DNA replication serves as an epigenetic mechanism for the inheritance of centromere position.",

Chemically synthesized DNA can carry small RNA sequence information but converting that information into small RNA is generally thought to require large double-stranded promoters in the context of plasmids, viruses and genes. We previously found evidence that circularized oligodeoxynucleotides (coligos) containing certain sequences and secondary structures can template the synthesis of small RNA by RNA polymerase III in vitro and in human cells. By using immunoprecipitated RNA polymerase III we now report corroborating evidence that this enzyme is the sole polymerase responsible for coligo transcription. The immobilized polymerase enabled experiments showing that coligo transcripts can be formed through transcription termination without subsequent 3' end trimming. To better define the determinants of productive transcription, a structure-activity relationship study was performed using over 20 new coligos. The results show that unpaired nucleotides in the coligo stem facilitate circumtranscription, but also that internal loops and bulges should be kept small to avoid secondary transcription initiation sites.

Circularized oligonucleotides, or coligos, were previously found to serve as RNA polymerase III (Pol III) templates in vitro and in human tissue culture cells. Here we randomized the 12-nucleotide larger loop (L-loop) of a well characterized coligo and found unexpectedly that in vitro transcription by FLAG-Pol III was not significantly affected. This observation allowed us to test the variable of coligo L-loop size separately from the variable of its sequence. Transcription efficiency increased with L-loop size from 3 to 12 nucleotides of randomized sequence, and the smallest loop forced initiation to move into the stem region. To test further the need for any specific sequence we compared seven nucleotide L-loops composed of random, abasic and abasic-acyclic nucleotides, and all supported transcription by Pol III. Transcription of a series of coligos containing twelve contiguous randomized nucleotides placed at different locations within the coligo structure provided further evidence that the stem-loop junction structure is important for precise initiation. Nearly the same transcript pattern was formed in vitro by Pol III from yeast and human cells. Overall, these experiments support structure, rather than L-loop sequence, as the major determinant of coligo transcription initiation by Pol III.",

PURPOSE: To clarify the association between clinically defined simple stress urinary incontinence (SUI) symptoms and urodynamic SUI, we examined the relationship between Valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP) as measured by the Q-tip test and Stamey grade in simple female SUI. METHODS: Two hundred grade I or II female SUI patients with SUI symptom were examined by reviewing medical history; physical examination; urethral mobility as assessed by Q-tip test; stress test; and cystometry, including VLPP measurement. On the basis of the VLPP, patients were classified into urethral hypermobility [UH, subdivided into anatomical incontinence (AI) and equivocal incontinence (EI)] or intrinsic sphincter deficiency groups for analysis of the relationship between VLPP and Stamey grade and Q-tip angle. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients were included, and the mean patient age was 54 \u00b1 7.5 years, mean SUI symptom duration 2.8 years (range 0.5-6 years), mean VLPP 103.6 \u00b1 18.4 cm H2O, and mean Q-tip angle 28.6\u00b0 \u00b1 7.2\u00b0. Fifty-three patients were categorized as Stamey grade I, 25 as Stamey grade II, 51 as AI, and 27 as EI. VLPP was found to be negatively correlated with Q-tip angle (Rs = -0.798, Y = -0.313X + 60.95, P < 0.001), and classifications of VLPP and Stamey grade have positive correlation (\u03c7 (2) = 4.9130, P = 0.0267).

OBJECTIVE: To compare the change of urethral mobility after midurethral sling procedures in stress urinary incontinence with hypermobile urethra and assess these findings with surgical outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: 141 women who agreed to undergo midurethral sling operations due to stress urinary incontinence with hypermobile urethra were enrolled in this non-randomized prospective observational study. Preoperatively, urethral mobility was measured by Q tip test. All women were asked to complete Urogenital Distress Inventory Short Form (UDI-6) and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire Short Form (IIQ-7) to assess the quality of life. Six months postoperatively, Q tip test and quality of life assessment were repeated. The primary surgical outcomes were classified as cure, improvement and failure. Transient urinary obstruction, de novo urgency, voiding dysfunction were secondary surgical outcomes. RESULTS: Of 141 women, 50 (35. 5%) women underwent TOT, 91 (64.5%) underwent TVT. In both TOT and TVT groups, postoperative Q tip test values, IIQ-7 and UDI-6 scores were statistically reduced when compared with preoperative values. Postoperative Q tip test value in TVT group was significantly smaller than in TOT group [25\u00b0(15-45\u00b0) and 20\u00b0 (15-45\u00b0), respectively]. When we compared the Q-tip test value, IIQ-7 and UDI-6 scores changes, there were no statistically significant changes between the groups. Postoperative urethral mobility was more frequent in TOT group than in TVT group (40% vs 23.1%, respectively). Postoperative primary and secondary outcomes were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although midurethral slings decrease the urethtal hypermobility, postoperative mobility status of urethra does not effect surgical outcomes of midurethral slings in women with preoperative urethral hypermobility.",

STUDY DESIGN: One hundred and ten patients were recruited for this randomized, single blind, multicenter, non-inferiority study, with a 1:1 ratio to undergo the traditional (n=55) or the modified (n=55) technique. Preoperatively, patients underwent POP-Q staging, Q-tip test, challenge stress test and urodynamics, and completed the I-QoL, PISQ-12, and PGI-S questionnaires. During the post-operative period, patients attributed a pain VAS score 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24h after the procedure and were followed up at 12 months, undergoing the same baseline evaluations. The primary outcome was the cure rate (absence of urine leaks at the challenge stress test or urodynamic testing) one year after the procedure.

METHODS: A total of 25 women affected by clinical stress urinary incontinence (SUI) were enrolled. After undergoing urodynamic assessment, pelvic organ prolapse quantification, urine culture, Q-tip test, and stress test, each subject underwent color Doppler ultrasonography to record clitoral blood flow and EMG of the urethral sphincter with a needle electrode inserted through the mucosa into the muscle tissue before surgery. A single urogynecologist performed the TOT surgical technique for the treatment of all patients. Urogynecologic examination, EMG, and color Doppler ultrasound follow-up were performed at 1 and 6 months after surgery. RESULTS: At the urogynecologic examination performed 1 and 6 months after the TOT approach the stress test was negative, urethral hypermobility was reduced, and sling exposure was not observed for each patient. There was no statistically significant difference in electromyographic values (p > 0.05) in both the follow-ups with regard to baseline values. Pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI), and peak systolic velocity (PSV) values increased during the first follow-up (p < 0.01); PI and RI values increased during the second follow-up with respect to baseline values (p < 0.01) CONCLUSIONS: TOT prosthesis surgery, avoiding denervation and devascularization of pelvic structures, does not damage the urethral sphincter.",

BACKGROUND: Low oxygen availability has been shown previously to stimulate M. tuberculosis to establish non-replicative persistence in vitro. The two component sensor/regulator dosRS is a major mediator in the transcriptional response of M. tuberculosis to hypoxia and controls a regulon of approximately 50 genes that are induced under this condition. The aim of this study was to determine whether the induction of the entire DosR regulon is triggered as a synchronous event or if induction can unfold as a cascade of events as the differential expression of subsets of genes is stimulated by different oxygen availabilities. RESULTS: A novel aspect of our work is the use of chemostat cultures of M. tuberculosis which allowed us to control environmental conditions very tightly. We exposed M. tuberculosis to a sudden drop in oxygen availability in chemostat culture and studied the transcriptional response of the organism during the transition from a high oxygen level (10% dissolved oxygen tension or DOT) to a low oxygen level (0.2% DOT) using DNA microarrays. We developed a Bayesian change point analysis method that enabled us to detect subtle shifts in the timing of gene induction. It results in probabilities of a change in gene expression at certain time points. A computational analysis of potential binding sites upstream of the DosR-controlled genes shows how the transcriptional responses of these genes are influenced by the affinity of these binding sites to DosR. Our study also indicates that a subgroup of DosR-controlled genes is regulated indirectly. CONCLUSION: The majority of the dosR-dependent genes were up-regulated at 0.2% DOT, which confirms previous findings that these genes are triggered by hypoxic environments. However, our change point analysis also highlights genes which were up-regulated earlier at levels of about 8% DOT indicating that they respond to small fluctuations in oxygen availability. Our analysis shows that there are pairs of divergent genes where one gene in the pair is up-regulated before the other, presumably for a flexible response to a constantly changing environment in the host.",

DevR regulon function is believed to be crucial for the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis during dormancy. In this study, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of the DevR regulon. All the regulon promoters were assigned to four classes based on the number of DevR binding sites (Dev boxes). A minimum of two boxes are essential for complete interaction and their tandem arrangement is an architectural hallmark at all promoters. Initial interaction of DevR with the conserved box is essential for its cooperative binding to adjacent sites bearing low to very poor sequence conservation and is the universal mechanism underlying DevR-mediated transcriptional induction. The functional importance of tandem arrangement was established by analyzing promoter variants harboring Dev boxes with altered spacing. Conserved sequence logos were generated from 47 binding sequences which included 24 newly discovered Dev boxes. In each half site of an 18-bp binding motif, G(5) and C(7) are essential for DevR binding. Finally, we show that DevR regulon induction occurs in a temporal manner and genes that are induced early are also usually powerfully induced. The information theory-based approach along with binding and temporal expression studies provide us with comprehensive insights into the complex pattern of DevR regulon activation.",

The dormancy survival regulator (DosR) regulon, composed of 48 co-regulated genes, is held as essential for Mtb persistence. The DosR regulon is regulated by a two-component regulatory system consisting of two sensor kinases-DosS (Rv3132c) and DosT (Rv2027c), and a response regulator DosR (Rv3133c). The underlying regulatory mechanism of DosR regulon expression is very complex. Many factors are involved, particularly the oxygen tension. The DosR regulon enables the pathogen to persist during lengthy hypoxia. Comparative genomic analysis demonstrated that the DosR regulon is widely distributed among the mycobacterial genomes, ranging from the pathogenic strains to the environmental strains.

Here we tested whether BCG vaccination results in immune responses to DosR (Rv3133c) regulon-encoded proteins. These so-called TB latency antigens are targeted by the immune system during persistent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and have been associated with immunity against latent M. tuberculosis infection. In silico analysis of the DosR regulon in BCG and M. tuberculosis showed at least 97% amino acid sequence homology, with 41 out of 48 genes being identical. Transcriptional profiling of 14 different BCG strains, under hypoxia and nitric oxide exposure in vitro, revealed a functional DosR regulon similar to that observed in M. tuberculosis. Next, we assessed human immune responses to a series of immunodominant TB latency antigens and found that BCG vaccination fails to induce significant responses to latency antigens. Similar results were obtained with BCG-vaccinated BALB/c mice. In contrast, responses to latency antigens were observed in individuals with suspected exposure to TB (as indicated by positive gamma interferon responses to TB-specific antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10) and in mice vaccinated with plasmid DNA encoding selected latency antigens.

A number of these cytokines are critical for lymphocyte development and mediating immune responses. JAK3 is of particular interest due to its importance in immune function and its expression, which is largely confined to lymphocytes, thus limiting the potential impact of JAK3 inhibition on nonimmune physiology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potency and selectivity of the investigational JAK3 inhibitor VX-509 (decernotinib) [(R)-2-((2-(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)pyrimidin-4-yl)amino)-2-methyl-N-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)butanamide] against JAK3 kinase activity and inhibition of JAK3-mediated signaling in vitro and JAK3-dependent physiologic processes in vivo. These results demonstrate that VX-509 potently inhibits JAK3 in enzyme assays (Ki = 2.5 nM + 0.7 nM) and cellular assays dependent on JAK3 activity (IC50 range, 50-170 nM), with limited or no measurable potency against other JAK isotypes or non-JAK kinases.

Sensing of viral RNA by the cytosolic receptors RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) leads to innate antiviral response. How RIG-I and MDA5 are dynamically regulated in innate antiviral response is not well understood. Here, we show that TRIM38 positively regulates MDA5- and RIG-I-mediated induction of downstream genes and acts as a SUMO E3 ligase for their dynamic sumoylation at K43/K865 and K96/K888, respectively, before and after viral infection. The sumoylation of MDA5 and RIG-I suppresses their K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation in uninfected or early-infected cells. Sumoylation of the caspase recruitment domains of MDA5 and RIG-I is also required for their dephosphorylation by PP1 and activation upon viral infection. At the late phase of viral infection, both MDA5 and RIG-I are desumoylated by SENP2, resulting in their K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation. These findings suggest that dynamic sumoylation and desumoylation of MDA5 and RIG-I modulate efficient innate immunity to RNA virus and its timely termination.",

The innate immune system plays a critical role in pathogen recognition and initiation of protective immune response through the recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by its pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Nucleic acids including RNA and DNA have been recognized as very important PAMPs of pathogens especially for viruses. RNA are the major PAMPs of RNA viruses, to which most severe disease causing viruses belong thus posing a tougher challenge to human and animal health. Therefore, the understanding of the immune biology of RNA PRRs is critical for control of pathogen infections especially for RNA virus infections. RNA PRRs are comprised of TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, RIG-I, MDA5, NLRP3, NOD2, and some other minorities. This review introduces these RNA PRRs by describing the cellular localizations, ligand recognitions, activation mechanisms, cell signaling pathways, and recognition of pathogens; the cross-talks between various RNA PRRs are also reviewed.

Melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) is a pattern recognition receptor that recognizes cytoplasmic viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and initiates rapid innate antiviral responses. MDA5 forms a filament-like multimer along the dsRNA leading to oligomerization, which in turn activates the adaptor protein mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) to provide a signal platform for the induction of type I interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines. The conformational switch of MDA5 causes antiviral defense, but excessive activation of the MDA5-MAVS pathway may result in autoimmune diseases. The regulatory mechanisms of MDA5 activation remain largely unknown. By yeast 2-hybrid, we identified DNAJB1, a member of the HSP40 (heat shock protein 40) family, as an MDA5-binding protein. HSP40s usually cowork with HSP70s. We found that dsRNA stimulation with physiological conditions upregulated the expression levels of DNAJB1 and HSP70; then the proteins were coupled and translocated into the stress granules, where MDA5 encounters dsRNA. DNAJB1 disrupted MDA5 multimer formation, resulting in the suppression of type I IFN induction. The disruption of endogenous DNAJB1 increased MDA5- and MAVS-mediated IFN promoter activation and rendered cells virus resistant. HSP70 inhibitor also enhanced the IFN-inducing function of MDA5 and MAVS.

Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that although the Bacteria in the human intestinal community were highly diverse, they fell mainly into 6 bacterial divisions that had distinct differences in the 3 study groups. Specifically, Firmicutes were dominant in normal-weight and obese individuals but significantly decreased in post-gastric-bypass individuals, who had a proportional increase of Gammaproteobacteria. Numbers of the H(2)-producing Prevotellaceae were highly enriched in the obese individuals. Unlike the highly diverse Bacteria, the Archaea comprised mainly members of the order Methanobacteriales, which are H(2)-oxidizing methanogens. Using real-time PCR, we detected significantly higher numbers of H(2)-utilizing methanogenic Archaea in obese individuals than in normal-weight or post-gastric-bypass individuals. The coexistence of H(2)-producing bacteria with relatively high numbers of H(2)-utilizing methanogenic Archaea in the gastrointestinal tract of obese individuals leads to the hypothesis that interspecies H(2) transfer between bacterial and archaeal species is an important mechanism for increasing energy uptake by the human large intestine in obese persons. The large bacterial population shift seen in the post-gastric-bypass individuals may reflect the double impact of the gut alteration caused by the surgical procedure and the consequent changes in food ingestion and digestion.",

Factors including age, genetics, and diet may influence microbiota composition. We used diet inventories and 16S rDNA sequencing to characterize fecal samples from 98 individuals. Fecal communities clustered into previously described enterotypes distinguished primarily by levels of Bacteroides and Prevotella. Enterotypes were associated with long-term diets, particularly protein and animal fat (Bacteroides) vs. simple carbohydrates (Prevotella). Although the distinction of enterotypes as either discrete clusters or a continuum will require additional investigation, numerous studies have demonstrated the co-exclusion of the closely related Prevotellaceae and Bacteroides genera in the gut microbiota of healthy human subjects where Prevotella appears to be a discriminatory taxon for residence in more agrarian societies. Ultimately, the impact of diet on the human gut microbiota may be an important environmental factor involved in the pathogenesis of disease states that show a rapidly increasing incidence in industrialized nations such as the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).",

All subjects showed a similar pattern of microbiota at the phylum level, where the relative abundance of Bacteriodetes species increased during the PFM ingestion period and decreased during the noningestion period. The increase in Bacteroidetes was found to be due to an increase in members of the families Bacteroidaceae or Prevotellaceae. In contrast to PFM-induced adaptation at the phylum level, the taxonomic composition at the genus level showed a considerable alteration in fecal microbiota induced by PFM ingestion. As revealed by analysis of operational taxonomic units (OTU), the numbers of shared OTU were low among the 3 different treatments (before, during, and after PFM ingestion), but the abundance of the shared OTU was relatively high, indicating that the majority (>77.8%) of total microbiota was maintained by shared OTU during PFM ingestion and after its termination.

We determined the gene copy number of DDX1 in 32 neuroblastoma patient samples (representative of all stages): 13 were MYCN amplified and 19 had normal copy numbers of the MYCN gene. Of the 13 neuroblastomas that were MYCN amplified, seven were also DDX1 amplified. Of the 19 that were not MYCN amplified, none were DDX1 amplified.

BACKGROUND: The development of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) has revolutionized oral anticoagulation. Rapid incorporation of NOACs into general practice has heightened the demand for directed reversal agents. Idarucizumab is a targeted reversal agent that is approved for the urgent reversal of the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran. While it is a welcome addition to reversal strategies of dabigatran, a number of clinical questions exist regarding its place in therapy. OBJECTIVE: We describe controversies regarding the use of idarucizumab therapy in patients with dabigatran-associated bleeding. DISCUSSION: Although existing clinical studies show a rapid reversal of coagulation assays, these studies did not describe a corresponding improvement in mortality or rapid cessation of hemorrhage. It is questionable how heavily clinicians can rely upon the use of the surrogate endpoints in clinical studies, such as ecarin clotting time and dilute thrombin time. Another issue is whether patients exhibiting re-elevation of coagulation assays would benefit from an additional dose of idarucizumab, because this has not been studied. It is currently unclear if blood products must be given in addition to idarucizumab can be used as monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The initial data suggest a definite role for idarucizumab in treatment of bleeding associated with dabigatran. As more clinical practice experience is gained with the agent and the remaining data on its use are released, clinicians can better guide the clinical use of idarucizumab. At present, there is currently not enough evidence for idarucizumab to be used as monotherapy.",

Major advantages of DOACS include fewer drug interactions and that they do not need periodic monitoring. Several patients who were not on anticoagulation before due to older age, polypharmacy/drug interaction concerns, and logistics of periodic monitoring are now on anticoagulation with DOACs. Despite their many advantages, a challenge while prescribing DOACs is very limited availability of specific reversal agents and lack of understanding or guidance about the treatment strategy in case of major life threatening bleeding or need for urgent surgery. So far only one reversal agent has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), idarucizumab for one of the DOACs i.e., dabigatran. Several other reversal agents are under final phases of development such as andexanet alfa and PER977 (ciraparantag) and will help in developing specific strategies for reversal of these agents. In this article, we review current strategies to manage bleeding with DOACs and provide guidance to clinicians of inhibiting LF activity in vitro and in cells, as well as in animal models of anthrax infection.",

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Idarucizumab is an antibody fragment that specifically reverses dabigatran-mediated anticoagulation. Safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of idarucizumab were investigated in dabigatran-treated, middle-aged, elderly and renally impaired volunteers with characteristics similar to patients receiving anticoagulant therapy. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, crossover study, 46 subjects (12 middle-aged, 45-64\u00a0years; 16 elderly, 65-80\u00a0years; and 18 with mild or moderate renal impairment) received dabigatran etexilate (DE; 220 or 150\u00a0mg twice daily) for 4\u00a0days. Idarucizumab doses of 1, 2.5 and 5\u00a0g or 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02.5\u00a0g 1\u00a0h apart, or placebo, were administered as a rapid (5\u00a0min) infusion ~2\u00a0h after DE at steady state. RESULTS: Dabigatran-prolonged diluted thrombin time, ecarin clotting time and activated partial thromboplastin time were reversed to baseline immediately after idarucizumab infusion in all groups. Reversal was sustained with doses > 2.5\u00a0g. Idarucizumab was well tolerated under all conditions. No impact of age on idarucizumab pharmacokinetics was observed; however, subjects with mild or moderate renal impairment demonstrated increased exposure (up to 84\u00a0%), decreased clearance and prolonged (by up to 49\u00a0%) initial half-life of idarucizumab compared with healthy middle-aged subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired renal function was associated with increased exposure and decreased clearance of idarucizumab. Idarucizumab resulted in immediate, complete and sustained reversal of dabigatran anticoagulant activity, and was safe and well tolerated in middle-aged, elderly and renally impaired volunteers. The results support the clinical use of a 5\u00a0g dose of idarucizumab. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov . Unique identifier: NCT01955720.",

We performed exome sequencing in two families, each with two affected males with Ohdo syndrome MKB type. In the two families, MED12 missense mutations (c.3443G>A [p.Arg1148His] or c.3493T>C [p.Ser1165Pro]) segregating with the phenotype were identified. Upon subsequent analysis of an additional cohort of nine simplex male individuals with Ohdo syndrome, one additional de novo missense change (c.5185C>A [p.His1729Asn]) in MED12 was detected. The occurrence of three different hemizygous missense mutations in three unrelated families affected by Ohdo syndrome MKB type shows that mutations in MED12 are the underlying cause of this X-linked form of Ohdo syndrome.

We report a family including 10 males and 1 female affected with profound non-specific intellectual disability (ID) which was linked to a 30-cM region extending from Xp11.21 (ALAS2) to Xq22.3 (COL4A5). Parallel sequencing of all X-chromosome exons identified a frameshift mutation (c.5898dupC) of MED12. Mutated mRNA was not affected by non-sense mediated RNA decay and induced an additional abnormal isoform due to activation of cryptic splice-sites in exon 41. Dysmorphic features common to most affected males were long narrow face, high forehead, flat malar area, high nasal bridge, and short philtrum. Language was absent or very limited. Most patients had a friendly personality. Cognitive impairment, varying from borderline to profound ID was similarly observed in seven heterozygous females. There was no correlation between cognitive function and X-chromosome inactivation profiles in blood cells. The severe degree of ID in male patients, as well as variable cognitive impairment in heterozygous females suggests that the duplication observed in the present family may have a more severe effect on MED12 function than missense mutations.

Overexpression of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore, ergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also increases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors Sut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control of the transcription factor Ste12. We suggest that during filamentation Ste12 becomes activated and reduces SUT1/SUT2 expression levels. This would result in increased UPC2 levels and as a consequence to transcriptional activation of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes.

Thus increasing brown and beige adipose tissue with augmented UCP1 expression is a viable target for obesity-related disorders. Recent work demonstrates an UCP1-independent pathway to uncouple mitochondrial respiration. A secreted enzyme, PM20D1, enriched in UCP1+ adipocytes, exhibits catalytic and hydrolytic activity to reversibly form N-acyl amino acids. N-acyl amino acids act as endogenous uncouplers of mitochondrial respiration at physiological concentrations. Administration of PM20D1 or its products, N-acyl amino acids, to diet-induced obese mice improves glucose tolerance by increasing energy expenditure.

Here we show that recombinant GDF15 induces weight loss in mice fed a high-fat diet and in nonhuman primates with spontaneous obesity. Furthermore, we find that GDF15 binds with high affinity to GDNF family receptor \u03b1-like (GFRAL), a distant relative of receptors for a distinct class of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily ligands. Gfral is expressed in neurons of the area postrema and nucleus of the solitary tract in mice and humans, and genetic deletion of the receptor abrogates the ability of GDF15 to decrease food intake and body weight in mice. In addition, diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance are exacerbated in GFRAL-deficient mice, suggesting a homeostatic role for this receptor in metabolism. Finally, we demonstrate that GDF15-induced cell signaling requires the interaction of GFRAL with the coreceptor RET. Our data identify GFRAL as a new regulator of body weight and as the bona fide receptor mediating the metabolic effects of GDF15, enabling a more comprehensive assessment of GDF15 as a potential pharmacotherapy for the treatment of obesity.",

BACKGROUND: Rilotumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively targets the ligand of the MET receptor, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). We aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of rilotumumab combined with epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine, and to assess potential biomarkers, in patients with advanced MET-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. METHODS: This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study was done at 152 centres in 27 countries. We recruited adults (aged > 18 years) with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, MET-positive tumours ( > 25% of tumour cells with membrane staining of > 1+ staining intensity), and evaluable disease, who had not received previous systemic therapy. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via a computerised voice response system to receive rilotumumab 15 mg/kg intravenously or placebo in combination with open-label chemotherapy (epirubicin 50 mg/m intravenously; cisplatin 60 mg/m intravenously; capecitabine 625 mg/m orally twice daily) in 21-day cycles for up to ten cycles. After completion of chemotherapy, patients continued to receive rilotumumab or placebo monotherapy until disease progression, intolerability, withdrawal of consent, or study termination. Randomisation was stratified by disease extent and ECOG performance status. Both patients and physicians were masked to study treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat. We report the final analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01697072. FINDINGS: Between Nov 7, 2012, and Nov 21, 2014, 609 patients were randomly assigned to rilotumumab plus epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine (rilotumumab group; n=304) or placebo plus epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine (placebo group; n=305). Study treatment was stopped early after an independent data monitoring committee found a higher number of deaths in the rilotumumab group than in the placebo group; all patients in the rilotumumab group subsequently discontinued all study treatment. Median follow-up was 7\u00b77 months (IQR 3\u00b76-12\u00b70) for patients in the rilotumumab group and 9\u00b74 months (5\u00b73-13\u00b71) for patients in the placebo group. Median overall survival was 8\u00b78 months (95% CI 7\u00b77-10\u00b72) in the rilotumumab group compared with 10\u00b77 months (9\u00b76-12\u00b74) in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio 1\u00b734, 95% CI 1\u00b710-1\u00b763; p=0\u00b7003). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in the rilotumumab and placebo groups were neutropenia (86 [29%] of 298 patients vs 97 [32%] of 299 patients), anaemia (37 [12%] vs 43 [14%]), and fatigue (30 [10%] vs 35 [12%]). The frequency of serious adverse events was similar in the rilotumumab and placebo groups (142 [48%] vs 149 [50%]). More deaths due to adverse events occurred in the rilotumumab group than the placebo group (42 [14%] vs 31 [10%]). In the rilotumumab group, 33 (11%) of 298 patients had fatal adverse events due to disease progression, and nine (3%) had fatal events not due to disease progression. In the placebo group, 23 (8%) of 299 patients had fatal adverse events due to disease progression, and eight (3%) had fatal events not due to disease progression. INTERPRETATION: Ligand-blocking inhibition of the MET pathway with rilotumumab is not effective in improving clinical outcomes in patients with MET-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma.

The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) binding antibody rilotumumab (AMG102) was modified for use as a Zr-based immuno-PET imaging agent to noninvasively determine the local levels of HGF protein in tumors. Because recent clinical trials of HGF-targeting therapies have been largely unsuccessful in several different cancers (e.g., gastric, brain, lung), we have synthesized and validated Zr-DFO-AMG102 as a companion diagnostic for improved identification and selection of patients having high local levels of HGF in tumors. To date, patient selection has not been performed using the local levels of HGF protein in tumors. Methods: The chelator p-SCN-Bn-DFO was conjugated to AMG102, radiolabeling with Zr was performed in high radiochemical yields and purity (>99%), and binding affinity of the modified antibody was confirmed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-type binding assay. PET imaging, biodistribution, autoradiography and immunohistochemistry, and ex vivo HGF ELISA experiments were performed on murine xenografts of U87MG (HGF-positive, MET-positive) and MKN45 (HGF-negative, MET-positive) and 4 patient-derived xenografts (MET-positive, HGF unknown). Results: Tumor uptake of Zr-DFO-AMG102 at 120 h after injection in U87MG xenografts (HGF-positive) was high (36.8 \u00b1 7.8 percentage injected dose per gram [%ID/g]), whereas uptake in MKN45 xenografts (HGF-negative) was 5.0 \u00b1 1.3 %ID/g and a control of nonspecific human IgG Zr-DFO-IgG in U87MG tumors was 11.5 \u00b1 3.3 %ID/g, demonstrating selective uptake in HGF-positive tumors. Similar experiments performed in 4 different gastric cancer patient-derived xenograft models showed low uptake of Zr-DFO-AMG102 (\u223c4-7 %ID/g), which corresponded with low HGF levels in these tumors (ex vivo ELISA). Autoradiography, immunohistochemical staining, and HGF ELISA assays confirmed that elevated levels of HGF protein were present only in U87MG tumors and that Zr-DFO-AMG102 uptake was closely correlated with HGF protein levels in tumors. Conclusion: The new immuno-PET imaging agent Zr-DFO-AMG102 was successfully synthesized, radiolabeled, and validated in vitro and in vivo to selectively accumulate in tumors with high local levels of HGF protein. These results suggest that Zr-DFO-AMG102 would be a valuable companion diagnostic tool for the noninvasive selection of patients with elevated local concentrations of HGF in tumors for planning any HGF-targeted therapy, with the potential to improve clinical outcomes.",

BACKGROUND: Dysregulated hepatocyte growth factor/mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) signaling is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We report outcomes from a double-blind, multicenter phase II trial of the MET inhibitor onartuzumab in combination with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab for mCRC (GO27827; NCT01418222). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive onartuzumab (10 mg/kg intravenously [IV]) or placebo plus mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV). Oxaliplatin was given for 8-12 cycles; other agents were continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and MET immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression-positive populations. RESULTS: Between September 2011 and November 2012, 194 patients were enrolled. In September 2013, an interim analysis recommended stopping onartuzumab treatment due to lack of efficacy. At the time of the final analysis in February 2014, no significant improvement in PFS was seen with onartuzumab versus placebo in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations. An improvement in PFS was noted in the MET IHC-negative population. Neither overall survival nor response rate was improved with onartuzumab. The incidence of fatigue, peripheral edema, and deep vein thrombosis was increased with onartuzumab relative to placebo. CONCLUSION: Onartuzumab combined with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab did not significantly improve efficacy outcomes in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations. MET expression by IHC was not a predictive biomarker in this setting. \n            The Oncologist\n           2017;22:264-271 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The addition of onartuzumab to mFOLFOX-6 plus bevacizumab did not improve outcomes in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer in this randomized, phase II study. Although initial results with onartuzumab were promising, a number of phase II/III clinical trials have reported a lack of improvement in efficacy with onartuzumab combined with standard-of-care therapies in several tumor types. Furthermore, negative study data have been published for rilotumumab and ficlatuzumab, both of which block hepatocyte growth factor binding to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor. MET immunohistochemistry was not a predictive biomarker. It remains to be seen if other biomarkers or small molecule inhibitors may be more appropriate for inhibiting this oncogenic pathway.",

The epidermal growth factor receptor family was targeted with monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) (trastuzumab, cetuximab, panitumumab) and tyrosin kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (lapatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib). Only trastuzumab, in combination with cisplatin and fluoropyrimidines, significantly improved overall survival (OS) in first-line therapy (13.8 vs. 11.1\u00a0months). Angiogenesis also was targeted with MoAbs (bevacizumab and ramucirumab); ramucirumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor 2 antagonist, enhanced OS in two phase III studies in the first (9.6 vs. 7.4\u00a0months) and subsequent lines of treatment (5.2 vs. 3.8\u00a0months), while the bevacizumab study was negative. TKIs (sunitinib, sorafenib, regorafenib, apatinib) were tested in this setting in phase II studies in the second/third line, only showing modest antitumor activity. The hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET) was targeted in untreated patients in a phase III trial with MoAb rilotumumab, with or without CT, but the study was stopped because of mortality excess in the rilotumumab arm.

BACKGROUND: Activation of the mesenchymal-epidermal transition factor (MET) tyrosine kinase and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), is implicated in resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. In this phase 1/2 trial, rilotumumab (an anti-HGF antibody) combined with erlotinib was evaluated in patients with metastatic, previously treated non-small cell lung cancer. METHODS: In phase 1, a dose de-escalation design was adopted with rilotumumab starting at 15 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks and oral erlotinib 150 mg daily. In phase 2, the disease control rate (DCR) (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) of the combination was evaluated using a Simon 2-stage design. The biomarkers examined included 10 plasma-circulating molecules associated with the EGFR and MET pathways. RESULTS: Without indications for de-escalation, the recommended phase 2 dose was dose level 0. Overall, 45 response-evaluable patients were enrolled (13 with squamous carcinoma, 32 with adenocarcinoma; 2 had confirmed EGFR mutations, 33 had confirmed wild-type [WT] EGFR, and 7 had KRAS mutations). The DCR for all patients was 60% (90% confidence interval [CI], 47.1%-71.3%). Median progression-free survival was 2.6 months (90% CI, 1.4-2.7 months), and median overall survival was 6.6 months (90% CI, 5.6-8.9 months). Among patients with WT EGFR, the DCR was 60.6% (90% CI, 46.3%-73.3%), median progression-free survival was 2.6 months (90% CI, 1.4-2.7 months), and median overall survival was 7.0 months (90% CI, 5.6-13.4 months). Elevated baseline levels of neuregulin 1 were associated with longer progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.19-0.87), whereas elevated amphiregulin levels were associated with more rapid progression (hazard ratio, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.48-3.08). CONCLUSIONS: Combined rilotumumab and erlotinib had an acceptable safety profile, and the DCR met the prespecified criteria for success. In the EGFR WT group, the DCR exceeded published reports for erlotinib alone. High circulating levels of neuregulin 1 may indicate sensitivity to this combination.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential pharmacokinetic (PK)-based drug-drug interaction (DDI) between rilotumumab and epirubicin (E), cisplatin(C) and capecitabine (X). METHODS: This was a Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled study, in which rilotumumab, epirubicin and cisplatin were administered intravenously at 15\u00a0mg\u00a0kg , 50\u00a0mg\u00a0m , and 60\u00a0mg\u00a0m Q3W, respectively, while capecitabine was given orally at 625\u00a0mg\u00a0m twice daily.

RESULTS: The study enrolled 609 patients. ECX plasma concentrations in the presence and absence of rilotumumab were similar, as demonstrated by the geometric mean ratios for C and AUC, which were close to 1.0, suggesting ECX PK was not affected by co-administration of rilotumumab. The observed rilotumumab serum concentrations were similar to the values predicted by population PK modelling on the basis of a prediction-corrected visual predictive check, indicating rilotumumab exposure was not affected by co-administration of ECX.

We also observed that E1B-55K lacking subnuclear PML localization because of either PML-IV or PML-V-binding deficiency was no longer capable of mediating E1B-55K-dependent SUMOylation of p53, inhibition of p53-mediated transactivation or efficiently transforming primary rodent cells. These results together with the observation that E1B-55K-dependent SUMOylation of p53 is required for efficient cell transformation, provides evidence for the idea that the SUMO ligase activity of the E1B-55K viral oncoprotein is intimately linked to its growth-promoting oncogenic activities.",

The small nuclear structures known as ND10 or PML nuclear bodies have been implicated in a variety of cellular processes including response to stress and interferons, oncogenesis, and viral infection, but little is known about their biochemical properties. Recently, a ubiquitin-specific protease enzyme (named HAUSP) and a ubiquitin-homology family protein (PIC1) have been found associated with ND10. HAUSP binds strongly to Vmw110, a herpesvirus regulatory protein which has the ability to disrupt ND10, while PIC1 was identified as a protein which interacts with PML, the prototype ND10 protein. We have investigated the role of ubiquitin-related pathways in the mechanism of ND10 disruption by Vmw110 and the effect of virus infection on PML stability. The results show that the disruption of ND10 during virus infection correlates with the loss of several PML isoforms and this process is dependent on active proteasomes. The PML isoforms that are most sensitive to virus infection correspond closely to those which have recently been identified as being covalently conjugated to PIC1. In addition, a large number of PIC1-protein conjugates can be detected following transfection of a PIC1 expression plasmid, and many of these are also eliminated in a Vmw110-dependent manner during virus infection. These observations provide a biochemical mechanism to explain the observed effects of Vmw110 on ND10 and suggest a simple yet powerful mechanism by which Vmw110 might function during virus infection.",

Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies are dynamic and heterogeneous nuclear protein complexes implicated in various important functions, most notably tumor suppression. PML is the structural component of PML nuclear bodies and has several nuclear splice isoforms that share a common N-terminal region but differ in their C termini. Previous studies have suggested that the coiled-coil motif within the N-terminal region is sufficient for PML nuclear body formation by mediating homo/multi-dimerization of PML molecules. However, it has not been investigated whether any of the C-terminal variants of PML may contribute to PML body assembly. Here we report that the unique C-terminal domains of PML-II and PML-V can target to PML-NBs independent of their N-terminal region. Strikingly, both domains can form nuclear bodies in the absence of endogenous PML. The C-terminal domain of PML-II interacts transiently with unknown binding sites at PML nuclear bodies, whereas the C-terminal domain of PML-V exhibits hyperstable binding to PML bodies via homo-dimerization. This strong interaction is mediated by a putative \u03b1-helix in the C terminus of PML-V. Moreover, nuclear bodies assembled from the C-terminal domain of PML-V also recruit additional PML body components, including Daxx and Sp100.

ND10 assembly is dependent on PML, which comprises several different isoforms, and depletion of all PML isoforms decreases cellular resistance to ICP0-null mutant HSV-1. We report that individual expression of PML isoforms I and II partially reverses the increase in ICP0-null mutant HSV-1 plaque formation that occurs in PML-depleted cells. This activity of PML isoform I is dependent on SUMO modification, its SUMO interaction motif (SIM), and each element of its TRIM domain. Detailed analysis revealed that the punctate foci formed by individual PML isoforms differ subtly from normal ND10 in terms of composition and/or Sp100 modification. Surprisingly, deletion of the SIM motif from PML isoform I resulted in increased colocalisation with other major ND10 components in cells lacking endogenous PML.

Arsenic is a clinically effective treatment for acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) in which the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein is fused to retinoic receptor alpha (RAR\u03b1). PML-RAR\u03b1 is degraded by the proteasome by a SUMO-dependent, ubiquitin-mediated pathway in response to arsenic treatment, curing the disease. Six major PML isoforms are expressed as a result of alternative splicing, each of which encodes a unique C-terminal region. Using a system in which only a single EYFP-linked PML isoform is expressed, we demonstrate that PMLI, PMLII and PMLVI accumulate in the cytoplasm following arsenic treatment, whereas PMLIII, PMLIV and PMLV do not. 3D structured illumination was used to obtain super-resolution images of PML bodies, revealing spherical shells of PML along with associated SUMO. Arsenic treatment results in dramatic isoform-specific changes to PML body ultrastructure. After extended arsenic treatment most PML isoforms are degraded, leaving SUMO at the core of the nuclear bodies. A high-content imaging assay identifies PMLV as the isoform most readily degraded following arsenic treatment, and PMLIV as relatively resistant to degradation. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates that all PML isoforms are modified by SUMO and ubiquitin after arsenic treatment, and by using siRNA, we demonstrate that arsenic-induced degradation of all PML isoforms is dependent on the ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF4. Intriguingly, depletion of RNF4 results in marked accumulation of PMLV, suggesting that this isoform is an optimal substrate for RNF4.

PML, the organizer of nuclear bodies (NBs), is expressed in several isoforms designated PMLI to VII which differ in their C-terminal region due to alternative splicing of a single gene. This variability is important for the function of the different PML isoforms. PML NB formation requires the covalent linkage of SUMO to PML. Arsenic trioxide (As\u2082O\u2083) enhances PML SUMOylation leading to an increase in PML NB size and promotes its interaction with RNF4, a poly-SUMO-dependent ubiquitin E3 ligase responsible for proteasome-mediated PML degradation. Furthermore, the presence of a bona fide SUMO Interacting Motif (SIM) within the C-terminal region of PML seems to be required for recruitment of other SUMOylated proteins within PML NBs. This motif is present in all PML isoforms, except in the nuclear PMLVI and in the cytoplasmic PMLVII. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay in living cells, we found that As\u2082O\u2083 enhanced the SUMOylation and interaction with RNF4 of nuclear PML isoforms (I to VI). In addition, among the nuclear PML isoforms, only the one lacking the SIM sequence, PMLVI, was resistant to As\u2082O\u2083-induced PML degradation. Similarly, mutation of the SIM in PMLIII abrogated its sensitivity to As\u2082O\u2083-induced degradation. PMLVI and PMLIII-SIM mutant still interacted with RNF4. However, their resistance to the degradation process was due to their inability to be polyubiquitinated and to recruit efficiently the 20S core and the \u03b2 regulatory subunit of the 11S complex of the proteasome in PML NBs. Such resistance of PMLVI to As\u2082O\u2083-induced degradation was alleviated by overexpression of RNF4. Our results demonstrate that the SIM of PML is dispensable for PML SUMOylation and interaction with RNF4 but is required for efficient PML ubiquitination, recruitment of proteasome components within NBs and proteasome-dependent degradation of PML in response to As\u2082O\u2083.",

Although the viral E6 protein is known to be essential for driving malignant progression of HPV-infected cells, there are still many uncertainties about its mode of action. In this study, we have analysed the intracellular distribution of the E6 oncoproteins from the high-risk HPV-18 and the low-risk HPV-11. We show that both E6 proteins localize within the nucleus in nuclear bodies that are confocal with the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein. Using a panel of different PML isoforms, we demonstrate specific co-localization between the E6 proteins and PML isoforms I-IV, but not with PML isoforms V and VI. We also demonstrate the interaction between E6 and a subset of PML isoforms in vivo. As a consequence of this interaction, the insoluble form of PML IV is destabilized by HPV-18 E6 through a proteasome-dependent pathway. Interestingly, both HPV-11 E6 and HPV-18 E6 can readily overcome PML IV-induced cellular senescence in primary cells.

Here we show that GDF15 binds specifically to GDNF family receptor \u03b1-like (GFRAL) with high affinity, and that GFRAL requires association with the coreceptor RET to elicit intracellular signaling in response to GDF15 stimulation. We also found that GDF15-mediated reductions in food intake and body weight of mice with obesity were abolished in GFRAL-knockout mice. We further found that GFRAL expression was limited to hindbrain neurons and not present in peripheral tissues, which suggests that GDF15-GFRAL-mediated regulation of food intake is by a central mechanism.

Arsenic is a clinically effective treatment for acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) in which the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein is fused to retinoic receptor alpha (RAR\u03b1). PML-RAR\u03b1 is degraded by the proteasome by a SUMO-dependent, ubiquitin-mediated pathway in response to arsenic treatment, curing the disease. Six major PML isoforms are expressed as a result of alternative splicing, each of which encodes a unique C-terminal region. Using a system in which only a single EYFP-linked PML isoform is expressed, we demonstrate that PMLI, PMLII and PMLVI accumulate in the cytoplasm following arsenic treatment, whereas PMLIII, PMLIV and PMLV do not. 3D structured illumination was used to obtain super-resolution images of PML bodies, revealing spherical shells of PML along with associated SUMO. Arsenic treatment results in dramatic isoform-specific changes to PML body ultrastructure. After extended arsenic treatment most PML isoforms are degraded, leaving SUMO at the core of the nuclear bodies. A high-content imaging assay identifies PMLV as the isoform most readily degraded following arsenic treatment, and PMLIV as relatively resistant to degradation. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates that all PML isoforms are modified by SUMO and ubiquitin after arsenic treatment, and by using siRNA, we demonstrate that arsenic-induced degradation of all PML isoforms is dependent on the ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF4. Intriguingly, depletion of RNF4 results in marked accumulation of PMLV, suggesting that this isoform is an optimal substrate for RNF4. Thus the variable C-terminal domain influences the rate and location of degradation of PML isoforms following arsenic treatment.",

The small nuclear structures known as ND10 or PML nuclear bodies have been implicated in a variety of cellular processes including response to stress and interferons, oncogenesis, and viral infection, but little is known about their biochemical properties. Recently, a ubiquitin-specific protease enzyme (named HAUSP) and a ubiquitin-homology family protein (PIC1) have been found associated with ND10. HAUSP binds strongly to Vmw110, a herpesvirus regulatory protein which has the ability to disrupt ND10, while PIC1 was identified as a protein which interacts with PML, the prototype ND10 protein. We have investigated the role of ubiquitin-related pathways in the mechanism of ND10 disruption by Vmw110 and the effect of virus infection on PML stability. The results show that the disruption of ND10 during virus infection correlates with the loss of several PML isoforms and this process is dependent on active proteasomes. The PML isoforms that are most sensitive to virus infection correspond closely to those which have recently been identified as being covalently conjugated to PIC1. In addition, a large number of PIC1-protein conjugates can be detected following transfection of a PIC1 expression plasmid, and many of these are also eliminated in a Vmw110-dependent manner during virus infection. These observations provide a biochemical mechanism to explain the observed effects of Vmw110 on ND10 and suggest a simple yet powerful mechanism by which Vmw110 might function during virus infection.",

Interestingly, after subsampling to the same coverage for GSNAP and TopHat, we find that both mappers have similar performance, implying that the advantage of TopHat is mainly an artifact of the lower coverage.

The most commonly used method for formally assessing grapheme-colour synaesthesia (i.e., experiencing colours in response to letter and/or number stimuli) involves selecting colours from a large colour palette on several occasions and measuring consistency of the colours selected. However, the ability to diagnose synaesthesia using this method depends on several factors that have not been directly contrasted. These include the type of colour space used (e.g., RGB, HSV, CIELUV, CIELAB) and different measures of consistency (e.g., city block and Euclidean distance in colour space). This study aims to find the most reliable way of diagnosing grapheme-colour synaesthesia based on maximising sensitivity (i.e., ability of a test to identify true synaesthetes) and specificity (i.e., ability of a test to identify true non-synaesthetes). We show, applying ROC (receiver operating characteristics) to binary classification of a large sample of self-declared synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes, that the consistency criterion (i.e., cut-off value) for diagnosing synaesthesia is considerably higher than the current standard in the field. We also show that methods based on perceptual CIELUV and CIELAB colour models (rather than RGB and HSV colour representations) and Euclidean distances offer an even greater sensitivity and specificity than most currently used measures. Together, these findings offer improved heuristics for the behavioural assessment of grapheme-colour synaesthesia.",

Synesthesia is an unusual condition in which stimulation of one modality evokes sensation or experience in another modality. Although discussed in the literature well over a century ago, synesthesia slipped out of the scientific spotlight for decades because of the difficulty in verifying and quantifying private perceptual experiences. In recent years, the study of synesthesia has enjoyed a renaissance due to the introduction of tests that demonstrate the reality of the condition, its automatic and involuntary nature, and its measurable perceptual consequences. However, while several research groups now study synesthesia, there is no single protocol for comparing, contrasting and pooling synesthetic subjects across these groups. There is no standard battery of tests, no quantifiable scoring system, and no standard phrasing of questions. Additionally, the tests that exist offer no means for data comparison. To remedy this deficit we have devised the Synesthesia Battery. This unified collection of tests is freely accessible online (http://www.synesthete.org). It consists of a questionnaire and several online software programs, and test results are immediately available for use by synesthetes and invited researchers. Performance on the tests is quantified with a standard scoring system. We introduce several novel tests here, and offer the software for running the tests. By presenting standardized procedures for testing and comparing subjects, this endeavor hopes to speed scientific progress in synesthesia research.",

Grapheme-color synesthesia, the idiosyncratic, arbitrary association of colors to letters or numbers, develops in childhood once reading is mastered.

We used synesthetic versions of the Stroop test with colored letters and numbers presented either in the right or the left visual field of thirty-four synesthetes. Interference by synesthetic colors was stronger for stimuli in the right hemifield (first experiment, color naming task). Synesthetes were also faster in the right hemifield when naming the synesthetic color of graphemes (second experiment). Overall, the lateralization effect was 7 ms (the 95% confidence interval was [1.5 12] ms), a delay compatible with an additional callosal transfer for stimuli presented in the left hemifield. Though weak, this effect suggests that the association of synesthetic colors to graphemes may be preferentially processed in the left hemisphere.

DNA methylation abolished this phasing primarily at enhancers and CpG island (CGI) promoters, with little effect on insulators and non-CGI promoters. Abolishment of DNA methylation led to the context-specific reestablishment of the poised and active states of normal colon cells, which were marked in methylation-deficient cells by distinct H3K27 modifications and the presence of either well-phased nucleosomes or nucleosome-depleted regions, respectively. At higher-order genomic scales, we found that long, H3K9me3-marked domains had lower accessibility, consistent with a more compact chromatin structure.

In an effort to study the correlations between DNA methylation, nucleosome remodeling, and gene reactivation, we investigate the integrated epigenetic events that worked coordinately to reprogram the methylated and closed promoters back to permissive chromatin configurations after 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment. The ChIP results indicate that H2A.Z is deposited at promoter regions by the Snf2-related CBP activator protein (SRCAP) complex following DNA demethylation. According to our genome-wide expression and DNA methylation profiles, we find that the complete re-activation of silenced genes requires the insertion of the histone variant H2A.Z, which facilitates the acquisition of regions fully depleted of nucleosome as demonstrated by NOMe-seq (Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome-sequencing) assay. In contrast, SRCAP-mediated H2A.Z deposition is not required for maintaining the active status of constitutively expressed genes. By combining Hpa II digestion with NOMe-seq assay, we show that hemimethylated DNA, which is generated following drug incorporation, remains occupied by nucleosomes. Our data highlight H2A.Z as a novel and essential factor involved in 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine-induced gene reactivation.

Despite the fact that 45% of all human gene promoters do not contain CpG islands, the role of DNA methylation in control of non-CpG island promoters is controversial and its relevance in normal and pathological processes is poorly understood. Among the few studies which investigate the correlation between DNA methylation and expression of genes with non-CpG island promoters, the majority do not support the view that DNA methylation directly leads to transcription silencing of these genes. Our reporter assays and gene reactivation by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a DNA demethylating agent, show that DNA methylation occurring at CpG poor LAMB3 promoter and RUNX3 promoter 1(RUNX3 P1) can directly lead to transcriptional silencing in cells competent to express these genes in vitro. Using Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome- Sequencing, NOMe-Seq, a single-molecule, high-resolution nucleosome positioning assay, we demonstrate that active, but not inactive, non-CpG island promoters display a nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) immediately upstream of the transcription start site (TSS). Furthermore, using NOMe-Seq and clonal analysis, we show that in RUNX3 expressing 623 melanoma cells, RUNX3 P1 has two distinct chromatin configurations: one is unmethylated with an NDR upstream of the TSS; another is methylated and nucleosome occupied, indicating that RUNX3 P1 is monoallelically methylated. Together, these results demonstrate that the epigenetic signatures comprising DNA methylation, histone marks and nucleosome occupancy of non-CpG island promoters are almost identical to CpG island promoters, suggesting that aberrant methylation patterns of non-CpG island promoters may also contribute to tumorigenesis and should therefore be included in analyses of cancer epigenetics.",

It is well established that cancer-associated epigenetic repression occurs concomitant with CpG island hypermethylation and loss of nucleosomes at promoters, but the role of nucleosome occupancy and epigenetic reprogramming at distal regulatory elements in cancer is still poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the scope of global epigenetic alterations at enhancers and insulator elements in prostate and breast cancer cells using simultaneous genome-wide mapping of DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy (NOMe-seq). We find that the genomic location of nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) is mostly cell type specific and preferentially found at enhancers in normal cells. In cancer cells, however, we observe a global reconfiguration of NDRs at distal regulatory elements coupled with a substantial reorganization of the cancer methylome. Aberrant acquisition of nucleosomes at enhancer-associated NDRs is associated with hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing marks, and conversely, loss of nucleosomes with demethylation and epigenetic activation. Remarkably, we show that nucleosomes remain strongly organized and phased at many facultative distal regulatory elements, even in the absence of a NDR as an anchor. Finally, we find that key transcription factor (TF) binding sites also show extensive peripheral nucleosome phasing, suggesting the potential for TFs to organize NDRs genome-wide and contribute to deregulation of cancer epigenomes. Together, our findings suggest that \"decommissioning\" of NDRs and TFs at distal regulatory elements in cancer cells is accompanied by DNA hypermethylation susceptibility of enhancers and insulator elements, which in turn may contribute to an altered genome-wide architecture and epigenetic deregulation in malignancy.",

Here, we report a novel segmentation-based method, TEPIC, to predict TF binding by combining sets of OCRs with position weight matrices. TEPIC can be applied to various open-chromatin data, e.g. DNaseI-seq and NOMe-seq. Additionally, Histone-Marks (HMs) can be used to identify candidate TF binding sites. TEPIC computes TF affinities and uses open-chromatin/HM signal intensity as quantitative measures of TF binding strength. Using machine learning, we find low affinity binding sites to improve our ability to explain gene expression variability compared to the standard presence/absence classification of binding sites. Further, we show that both footprints and peaks capture essential TF binding events and lead to a good prediction performance. In our application, gene-based scores computed by TEPIC with one open-chromatin assay nearly reach the quality of several TF ChIP-seq data sets.

BACKGROUND: Splicing is more efficient when coupled with transcription and it has been proposed that nucleosomes enriched in exons are important for splice site recognition. Lynch syndrome is a familial cancer syndrome that can be caused by the autosomal dominant inheritance of splice site mutations in the MutL homolog 1 (MLH1) gene. To better understand the role of nucleosomes in splicing, we used MLH1 splice site mutations in Lynch syndrome cases as a model to investigate if abnormal splicing was associated with altered nucleosome positioning at exon-intron boundaries. FINDINGS: Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) was used to determine the allele-specific positioning of nucleosomes around heterozygous splice site mutations in lymphoblastoid cells lines (LCLs) derived from six Lynch syndrome patients. These mutations were previously shown to cause exon skipping in five of the six patients. Allele-specific high-resolution nucleosome mapping across exons and exon-intron boundaries revealed high levels of nucleosomes across all regions examined. Alleles containing donor or acceptor splice site mutations showed no consistent alteration in nucleosome positioning or occupancy. CONCLUSION: Nucleosomes were enriched at MLH1 exons in LCLs derived from Lynch syndrome patients, and in this model system the positioning of nucleosomes was unaltered at exon-intron boundaries containing splice site mutations. Thus, these splice site mutations alone do not significantly change the local organisation of nucleosomes.",

It was suggested that these mutations affect the functional interaction between RNAPII and transcription-elongation factor TFIIS because the 6AU-sensitive phenotype of the mutant strains was similar to that of a strain defective in the production of TFIIS and can be suppressed by increasing the dosage of the yeast TFIIS-encoding gene, PPR2, RNAPIIs were purified and characterized from two independent 6AU-sensitive yeast mutants and from wild-type (wt) cells. In vitro, in the absence of TFIIS, the purified wt polymerase and the two mutant polymerases showed similar specific activity in polymerization, readthrough at intrinsic transcriptional arrest sites and nascent RNA cleavage. In contrast to the wt polymerase, both mutant polymerases were not stimulated by the addition of a 3-fold molar excess of TFIIS in assays of promoter-independent transcription, readthrough or cleavage. However, stimulation of the ability of the mutant RNAPIIs to cleave nascent RNA and to read through intrinsic arrest sites was observed at TFIIS:RNAPII molar ratios greater than 600:1. Consistent with these findings, the binding affinity of the mutant polymerases for TFIIS was found to be reduced by more than 50-fold compared with that of the wt enzyme.

Notably, RNA polymerase I (Pol I) and Pol II recover from shallow backtracks by 1D diffusion, use RNA cleavage to recover from intermediary depths, and are unable to recover from extensive backtracks. Furthermore, Pol I and Pol II use distinct mechanisms to avoid nonrecoverable backtracking. Pol I is protected by its subunit A12.2, which decreases the rate of 1D diffusion and enables transcript cleavage up to 20 nt. In contrast, Pol II is fully protected through association with the cleavage stimulatory factor TFIIS, which enables rapid recovery from any depth by RNA cleavage.

Here we show that Pol II gains strong cleavage activity when the C-terminal zinc ribbon domain (C-ribbon) of subunit Rpb9 is replaced by its counterpart from the Pol III subunit C11. X-ray analysis shows that the C-ribbon has detached from its site on the Pol II surface and is mobile. Mutagenesis indicates that the C-ribbon transiently inserts into the Pol II pore to complement the active center. This mechanism is also used by transcription factor IIS, a factor that can bind Pol II and induce strong RNA cleavage. Together with published data, our results indicate that Pol I and Pol III contain catalytic C-ribbons that complement the active center, whereas Pol II contains a non-catalytic C-ribbon that is immobilized on the enzyme surface.

The gene TOP2 encoding yeast topoisomerase II has been cloned by immunological screening of a yeast genomic library constructed in the phage lambda expression vector, lambda gt11. The ends of the message encoded by the cloned DNA fragment were delimited by the Berk and Sharp procedure (S1 nuclease mapping) for the 5' end and mapping of the polyA tail portion of a cDNA fragment for the 3' end. The predicted size of the message agrees with the length of the message as determined by Northern blot hybridization analysis. The identity of the gene was confirmed by expressing the gene in E. coli from the E. coli promoter lac UV5 to give catalytically active yeast DNA topoisomerase II. Disruption of one copy of the gene in a diploid yeast creates a recessive lethal mutation, indicating that the single DNA topoisomerase II gene of yeast has an essential function.",

Since DNA topoisomerase II (EC 5.99.1.3) is an essential enzyme in yeast, heterologous topoisomerase II gene expression in yeast cells can provide a system for analyzing the structure and function of topoisomerase II genes from other species. A series of yeast expression plasmids was constructed in which segments of the cDNA sequences encoding Drosophila DNA topoisomerase II were inserted under the transcriptional control of yeast GAL1 promoter. Expression of the functional form of Drosophila topoisomerase II cDNA can complement conditionally lethal, temperature-sensitive mutations in the yeast topoisomerase II gene (TOP2), as well as mutations in which the TOP2 locus was disrupted. The survival of these yeast cells depends upon the continuous expression of Drosophila topoisomerase II. Repression of Drosophila gene expression by glucose causes these yeast cells to cease dividing after a few generations. In addition to these genetic complementation data, the expression of the Drosophila topoisomerase II gene in yeast cells with a disruption in TOP2 can also be detected by immunochemical methods with an antibody specific for Drosophila topoisomerase II.",

Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II is an abundant nuclear enzyme that is essential for cell proliferation. This homodimeric enzyme catalyzes the cleavage and re-ligation of double-stranded DNA required to separate replicated sister chromatids. Both biochemical and genetic studies show that its catalytic activity is required for chromosome condensation and segregation, and that its decatenation activity can be stimulated by a variety of protein kinases in vitro. In budding yeast, topoisomerase II is most highly phosphorylated in metaphase, and casein kinase II (CKII) was shown to be the major kinase modifying topoisomerase II. We have investigated the effects of phosphorylation of yeast topoisomerase II by CKII in vitro, by means of gel-retardation and filter binding assays. The phosphorylation of the C terminus of topoisomerase II by CKII appears to increase the stability of the complex formed with linear DNA fragments, while dephosphorylation has the opposite effect. Rephosphorylation of phosphatase-treated topoisomerase II by chicken casein kinase II restores a stable protein-DNA complex using a linear DNA fragment. The enhanced stability of the topoisomerase II-DNA complex is also observed with relaxed circular DNA, but not with supercoiled minicircles, in agreement with published results using topoisomerase II from Drosophila. Limited proteolysis and probing with domain-specific antibodies shows that, with the exception of a weakly modified residue between amino acid residues 660 and 1250, all residues modified by casein kinase II are in the last 180 amino acid residues of yeast topoisomerase II.",

Topoisomerase II (Topo II) performs topological modifications on double-stranded DNA molecules that are essential for chromosome condensation, resolution, and segregation. In mammals, G2 and metaphase cell cycle delays induced by Topo II poisons have been proposed to be the result of checkpoint activation in response to the catenation state of DNA. However, the apparent lack of such controls in model organisms has excluded genetic proof that Topo II checkpoints exist and are separable from the conventional DNA damage checkpoint controls. But here, we define a Topo II-dependent G2/M checkpoint in a genetically amenable eukaryote, budding yeast, and demonstrate that this checkpoint enhances cell survival. Conversely, a lack of the checkpoint results in aneuploidy. Neither DNA damage-responsive pathways nor Pds1/securin are needed for this checkpoint. Unusually, spindle assembly checkpoint components are required for the Topo II checkpoint, but checkpoint activation is not the result of failed chromosome biorientation or a lack of spindle tension. Thus, compromised Topo II function activates a yeast checkpoint system that operates by a novel mechanism.",

Type II topoisomerases are essential for resolving topologically entwined double-stranded DNA. Although anti-topoisomerase 2 (Top2) drugs are clinically important antibiotics and chemotherapies, to our knowledge, the mechanisms of cell killing by Top2 depletion and inactivation have never been directly compared. We show that depletion of Top2 protein from budding yeast cells prevents DNA decatenation during S phase. Cells complete DNA replication and enter the ensuing mitosis on schedule, suffering extensive chromosome missegregation. Cytokinesis through incompletely segregated chromosomes causes lethal DNA damage. By contrast, expression of catalytically inactive Top2 causes a stable G2 arrest requiring an intact DNA damage checkpoint. Checkpoint activation correlates with an inability to complete DNA replication, resulting in hypercatenated, gapped daughter DNA molecules. Thus, Top2 depletion and inactivation kill cells by different mechanisms, which has implications for understanding the nature of the catenation checkpoint, how DNA replication terminates, how anti-Top2 drugs work, and how new drugs might be designed.",

Topoisomerase II is a ubiquitous enzyme that removes knots and tangles from the genetic material by generating transient double-strand DNA breaks. While the enzyme cannot perform its essential cellular functions without cleaving DNA, this scission activity is inherently dangerous to chromosomal integrity. In fact, etoposide and other clinically important anticancer drugs kill cells by increasing levels of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA breaks. Cells rely heavily on recombination to repair double-strand DNA breaks, but the specific pathways used to repair topoisomerase II-generated DNA damage have not been defined. Therefore, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as a model system to delineate the recombination pathways that repair DNA breaks generated by topoisomerase II. Yeast cells that expressed wild-type or a drug-hypersensitive mutant topoisomerase II or overexpressed the wild-type enzyme were examined. Based on cytotoxicity and recombination induced by etoposide in different repair-deficient genetic backgrounds, double-strand DNA breaks generated by topoisomerase II appear to be repaired primarily by the single-strand invasion pathway of homologous recombination. Non-homologous end joining also was triggered by etoposide treatment, but this pathway was considerably less active than single-strand invasion and did not contribute significantly to cell survival in S.cerevisiae.",

Two type I topoisomerase mutants (top1) and three endonuclease mutants (end1) were all viable. The double mutant top1 end1 was also viable and, in its extract, Mg2+- and ATP- dependent type II activity could be detected. Three temperature-sensitive (ts-) mutants having heat-sensitive (hs-) type II enzymes were isolated, and the ts- marker cosegregated with the hs- type II activity. All the ts- mutations fell in one gene (top2) tightly linked to leul in chromosome II. The nuclear division of single top2 mutants was blocked at the restrictive temperature, but the formation of a septum was not inhibited so that the nucleus was cut across with the cell plate. In contrast, the double top1 top2 mutants were rapidly arrested at various stages of the cell cycle, showing a strikingly altered nuclear chromatin region. The type II topoisomerase may have an essential role in the compaction and/or segregation of chromosomes during the nuclear division but also complement the defect of the type I enzyme whose major function is the maintenance of chromatin organization throughout the cell cycle.",

Eukaryotic topoisomerase II (topo II) is the essential decatenase of newly replicated chromosomes and the main relaxase of nucleosomal DNA. Apart from these general tasks, topo II participates in more specialized functions. In mammals, topo II\u03b1 interacts with specific RNA polymerases and chromatin-remodeling complexes, whereas topo II\u03b2 regulates developmental genes in conjunction with chromatin remodeling and heterochromatin transitions. Here we show that in budding yeast, topo II regulates the expression of specific gene subsets. To uncover this, we carried out a genomic transcription run-on shortly after the thermal inactivation of topo II. We identified a modest number of genes not involved in the general stress response but strictly dependent on topo II. These genes present distinctive functional and structural traits in comparison with the genome average. Yeast topo II is a positive regulator of genes with well-defined promoter architecture that associates to chromatin remodeling complexes; it is a negative regulator of genes extremely hypo-acetylated with complex promoters and undefined nucleosome positioning, many of which are involved in polyamine transport. These findings indicate that yeast topo II operates on singular chromatin architectures to activate or repress DNA transcription and that this activity produces functional responses to ensure chromatin stability.",

DNA topoisomerases are specialized nuclear enzymes that perform topological modifications on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and hence are essential for DNA metabolism such as replication, transcription, recombination, condensation and segregation. In a genetic screen, we identified a temperature-sensitive mutant allele of topoisomerase 2 that exhibits conditional synthetic lethality with a chk1 knockout strain. The mutant allele of topoisomerase 2 is defective in chromosome segregation at a non-permissive temperature and there was increase in chromosome segregation defects in the double mutant of top2-10 and chk1 delete at a non-permissive temperature. More importantly, topoisomearse 2 mutant cells mildly delay the mitotic progression at non-permissive temperature that is mediated by checkpoint protein kinase Chk1. Additionally, top2-10 mutant cells also activate the Chk1 at a non-permissive temperature and this activation of Chk1 takes place at the time of mitosis. Interestingly, top2-10 mutant cells retain their viability at a non-permissive temperature if the cells are not allowed to enter into mitosis. Taking together our results, we speculate that in the top2-10 mutant, the segregation of entangled chromatids during mitosis could result in delaying the mitotic progression through the activation of Chk1 kinase.",
