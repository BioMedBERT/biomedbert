In budding yeast, a single cenH3 (Cse4) nucleosome occupies the \u223c120-bp functional centromere, however conflicting structural models for the particle have been proposed. To resolve this controversy, we have applied H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping, which reveals the precise position of histone H4 in every nucleosome in the genome. We find that cleavage patterns at centromeres are unique within the genome and are incompatible with symmetrical structures, including octameric nucleosomes and (Cse4/H4)2 tetrasomes. Centromere cleavage patterns are compatible with a precisely positioned core structure, one in which each of the 16 yeast centromeres is occupied by oppositely oriented Cse4/H4/H2A/H2B hemisomes in two rotational phases within the population. Centromere-specific hemisomes are also inferred from distances observed between closely-spaced H4 cleavages, as predicted from structural modeling. Our results indicate that the orientation and rotational position of the stable hemisome at each yeast centromere is not specified by the functional centromere sequence.

Centromeres of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe lack the highly repetitive sequences that make most other \"regional\" centromeres refractory to analysis. To map fission yeast centromeres, we applied H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping and native and cross-linked chromatin immunoprecipitation with paired-end sequencing. H3 nucleosomes are nearly absent from the central domain, which is occupied by centromere-specific H3 (cenH3 or CENP-A) nucleosomes with two H4s per particle that are mostly unpositioned and are more widely spaced than nucleosomes elsewhere. Inner kinetochore proteins CENP-A, CENP-C, CENP-T, CENP-I, and Scm3 are highly enriched throughout the central domain except at tRNA genes, with no evidence for preferred kinetochore assembly sites. These proteins are weakly enriched and less stably incorporated in H3-rich heterochromatin. CENP-A nucleosomes protect less DNA from nuclease digestion than H3 nucleosomes, while CENP-T protects a range of fragment sizes. Our results suggest that CENP-T particles occupy linkers between CENP-A nucleosomes and that classical regional centromeres differ from other centromeres by the absence of CENP-A nucleosome positioning.",

Nucleosomes in active chromatin are dynamic, but whether they have distinct structural conformations is unknown. To identify nucleosomes with alternative structures genome-wide, we used H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping, which revealed that 5% of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) nucleosome positions have asymmetric histone-DNA interactions. These asymmetric interactions are enriched at nucleosome positions that flank promoters. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) sequence-based profiles of asymmetric nucleosome positions revealed a corresponding asymmetry in MNase protection near the dyad axis, suggesting that the loss of DNA contacts around H4S47 is accompanied by protection of the DNA from MNase. Chromatin immunoprecipitation mapping of selected nucleosome remodelers indicated that asymmetric nucleosomes are bound by the RSC chromatin remodeling complex, which is required for maintaining nucleosomes at asymmetric positions. These results imply that the asymmetric nucleosome-RSC complex is a metastable intermediate representing partial unwrapping and protection of nucleosomal DNA on one side of the dyad axis during chromatin remodeling.",

CircRNAs are conserved across different species and display specific organization, sequence, and expression in disease. Moreover, circRNAs' closed ring structure, insensitivity to RNase, and stability are advantages over linear RNAs in terms of development and application as a new kind of clinical marker. In addition, according to recent studies, circular RNA-7 (ciRS-7) acts as a sponge of miR-7 and thus inhibits its activity. Numerous evidences have confirmed expression of miR-7 is dysregulated in cancer tissues, however, whether ciRS-7 invovled in oncogenesis by acting as sponge of miR-7 remains unclear. Most recently, a study reported ciRS-7 acted as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma through targeting miR-7 expression. This suggest ciRS-7/ miR-7 axis affects oncogenesis, and it provides a new perspective on the mechanisms of decreased miR-7 expression in cancer tissues. Discovery of sponge role of circRNAs caused researchers to more closely explore the underlying mechanism of carcinogenesis and has significant clinical implications, and may open a new chapter in research on the pathology and treatment of cancers. This review summarizes the structure and function of circRNAs and provides evidence for the impact of ciRS-7 in promoting the development of cancer by acting as sponge of miR-7.",

Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among females in economically developing countries. Greater than 95% of breast malignancies are of epithelial origin; the induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been shown to initiate the metastatic process in breast carcinoma and remains the key target for drug development. Here, we examine the anti-metastatic potential of pterostilbene in modulating EMT process in breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. The differential invasive ability among MCF7, Hs578t and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines were closely correlated with the expression of EMT markers, determined by Western blots and Matrigel-coated transwells assay. Pterostilbene inhibited the migratory and invasive potential of triple-negative MDA-MB-231 and Hs578t cells, accompanied by the up-regulation of E-cadherin and down-regulation of Snail, Slug, vimentin and ZEB1. Mechanistic investigations revealed a significant up-regulation of miR-205, which resulted in the reduction of Src expression in pterostilbene-treated breast cancer cells. Importantly, pterostilbene suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in MDA-MB-231-bearing NOD/SCID mice by reducing Src/Fak signaling; this observation was consistent with the negative correlations between miR-205 and Src expression in both normal and malignant breast tissues. Our findings provide supports for the usage of pterostilbene as an inhibitor of EMT process and potential candidate for adjuvant therapy.",

Detecting heterogenic tumor cells that are traveling in our body through blood stream for the tumor metastasis is one way for cancer prognosis. Due to the heterogeneity of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), further identification of tumor cell types should be accompanied with CTCs isolation from blood cells in peripheral blood sample. Both negative enrichment and recollection of isolated CTCs are required in the downstream analysis, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and massive equipment required. To solve these limitations, we have developed a simple and disposable spiral shape microfluidic channel that can separate all CTCs from blood cells, and at the same time, can identify the types of CTCs based on epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) expression level. Two different types of tumor cells, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, both from the same origin of breast carcinoma cells, were used to demonstrate the functionality of the developed system. The spiral channel system could capture the EpCAM positive and negative CTCs with 96.3% and 81.2% purity, respectively, while both EpCAM positive and negative CTCs were differently positioned along the microfluidic channel. The average selectivity of EpCAM positive and negative CTCs is 6.1:4.8. In addition, the throughput of the system was optimized at a sample flow rate of 150\u00b5l/min. The developed system successfully demonstrated its potential to identify biomarkers, including EpCAM, for detecting the heterogenic CTCs.",

In this study, we investigated the levels of 27-OHC, and other sidechain-hydroxylated oxysterols in exosomes. To study both cytoplasmic and exosomal oxysterol samples of limited size, we have developed a capillary liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry platform that outperforms our previously published systems regarding chromatographic resolution, analysis time and sensitivity. In the analyzed samples, the quantified level of cytoplasmic 27-OHC using this platform fitted with mRNA levels of 27-OHC's corresponding enzyme, CYP27A1. We find clearly increased levels of 27-OHC in exosomes (i.e., enrichment) from an ER+ breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) compared to exosomes derived from an estrogen receptor (ER-) breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231) and other control exosomes (non-cancerous cell line (HEK293) and human pooled serum). The exosomal oxysterol profile did not reflect cytoplasmic oxysterol profiles in the cells of origin; cytoplasmic 27-OHC was low in ER+ MCF-7 cells while high in MDA-MB-231 cells. Other control cancer cells showed varied cytoplasmic oxysterol levels. Hence, exosome profiling in cancer cells might provide complementary information with the possibility of diagnostic value.",

PURPOSE: Dinutuximab (Unituxin\u2122; ch14.18), a monoclonal antibody against disialoganglioside, improved survival as part of post-consolidation therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma. United Therapeutics Corporation (UTC) assumed ch14.18 production from the National Cancer Institute (NCI); this study evaluates pharmacokinetic comparability, safety, and tolerability of UTC and NCI products. METHODS: In this randomized, two-sequence crossover study, 28 patients aged < 8\u00a0years with high-risk neuroblastoma received equivalent ch14.18-UTC or ch14.18-NCI doses. Despite comparable protein content, nominal doses differed: 17.5\u00a0mg/m(2)/day (ch14.18-UTC) and 25\u00a0mg/m(2)/day (ch14.18-NCI). Patients received one product during therapy cycles 1 and 2, the other during cycles 3-5. Ch14.18 pharmacokinetic profile characterization used population modeling (NONMEM(\u00ae) version 7.2). A two-compartment model with first-order distribution and elimination processes described pharmacokinetic data. Estimated product parameters were normalized to UTC nominal dose. For pharmacokinetic comparability, the final model was used to estimate exposure ratios (UTC/NCI) and associated 90\u00a0% confidence intervals (CIs) for area under the curve from time zero to infinity (AUCinf) and maximum concentration (C max). All comparisons were based on a standardized single-dose regimen (17.5\u00a0mg/m(2) over 10\u00a0h). RESULTS: Final-model pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to previously published ch14.18-NCI parameters and comparable for UTC and NCI products. Products' systemic exposures were comparable, with 90\u00a0% CIs around ratios for AUCinf (0.96; 90\u00a0% CI 0.88-1.04) and C max (1.04; 90\u00a0% CI 0.98-1.11) within standard bioequivalence bounds (90\u00a0% CI 0.80-1.25). Products' adverse events were similar and consistent with those previously reported. CONCLUSIONS: Equivalent actual ch14.18-UTC and ch14.18-NCI doses produced comparable exposures, with no notable safety or tolerability differences.",

Considering the importance of combining antiretrovirals for their optimal use in treating HIV, a number of drug-drug interactions with etravirine and other antiretrovirals have been evaluated. Etravirine is a weak inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A and a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9/CYP2C19 and P-glycoprotein, and although etravirine is metabolized by the CYP enzyme system, the extent of clinically relevant interactions with other antiretrovirals is limited. Etravirine can be combined with all currently available nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors without dose adjustments, but not with other NNRTIs. Available data indicate that etravirine can be coadministered with most of the currently available ritonavir-boosted HIV protease inhibitors. Coadministration with tipranavir/ritonavir or unboosted HIV protease inhibitors is not recommended because of clinically relevant changes in exposure to etravirine or the coadministered HIV protease inhibitor, respectively. Etravirine can be coadministered with the integrase inhibitors elvitegravir/ritonavir or raltegravir, and with the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide, without dose adjustments. Dose adjustment of the C-C chemokine receptor type-5 antagonist maraviroc is required, with the type of adjustment depending on whether a boosted HIV protease inhibitor is included in the regimen.

We now analyze and summarize the predictive performance of PBPK models for the effect of CYP3A inducers on a substrate's pharmacokinetics. METHODS: This analysis was based on 11 substrate PBPK models, developed by six sponsors, using a commercial PBPK software, with 13 clinical interaction studies. Four CYP3A inducers were used: rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, and efavirenz. Sponsors either directly used the software-provided inducer models or verified these models' induction magnitude prior to use. The metric for assessing predictive performance was the R predicted/observed value [R predicted/observed = (predicted mean exposure ratio)/(observed mean exposure ratio)], with the exposure ratio defined as maximum plasma concentration (C max) or area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) with and without an inducer. RESULTS: In 77% (10/13; AUCR) and 83% (10/12; C max R) of the cases, the R predicted/observed values were within 1.25-fold of the observed data. Cases with R predicted/observed values >1.25-fold (>twofold for all three AUCR) were under-predictions as a result of using the PBPK software's default rifampicin model. Improved predictions were observed when the rifampicin model was modified by increasing the induction potency. CONCLUSION: Based on submissions to the FDA, and similar to our previous findings for CYP inhibition, we observed good agreement between PBPK-predicted and observed effect of CYP3A inducers on substrate pharmacokinetics. Verification of the inducer model appears to be crucial for improved predictive performance.",

Chimpanzee and gorilla chromosomes differ from human chromosomes by the presence of large blocks of subterminal heterochromatin thought to be composed primarily of arrays of tandem satellite sequence.

These regions are highly copy number polymorphic between and within species, and copy number differences involving hundreds of copies can be accurately estimated by assaying read-depth of next-generation sequencing data sets. Phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses suggest that the structures have arisen largely independently in the two lineages with the exception of a few seed sequences present in the common ancestor of humans and African apes. We propose a model where an ancestral human-chimpanzee pericentric inversion and the ancestral chromosome 2 fusion both predisposed and protected the chimpanzee and human genomes, respectively, to the formation of subtelomeric heterochromatin.

It is known that human chromosome 2 originated from the fusion of two ancestral primate chromosomes. This has been confirmed by chromosome banding and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) with human chromosome-2-specific DNA libraries. In this study, the order of 38 cosmid clones derived from the human chromosome region 2q12-q14 was exactly determined by high-resolution FISH in human chromosome 2 and its homologous chromosomes in chimpanzees (Pan trogrodydes, 2n=48) and cynomolgus monkeys (Macacafascicularis, 2n = 42). This region includes the telomere-to-telomere fusion point of two ancestral ape-type chromosomes. As a result of comparative mapping, human chromosome region 2q12-q14 was found to correspond to the short arms of chimpanzee chromosomes 12 and 13 and cynomolgus monkey chromosomes 9 and 15. It is noted that no difference was detected in the relative order of the cosmid clones between human and chimpanzee chromosomes. This suggests that two ancestral ape-type chromosomes fused tandemly at telomeres to form human chromosome 2, and the genomic organization of this region is thought to be considerably conserved. In the cynomolgus monkey, however, the order of clones in each homologue was inverted.

Aim Spinal epidural hematomas are rare entity in neurosurgery practice. Most of them are spontaneous due to anticoagulant therapy and called spontaneous spinal epidural hematomas (SSEHs). Laminectomy or hemilaminectomy for affected levels is still the first choice in the operative treatment of an SSEH. We describe a new less invasive surgical technique, performing single-level laminectomy and washing with 0.9% sodium chloride through a thin soft catheter for a 12-level thoracic-cervical SSEH in a patient under anticoagulant therapy. Patient and Operative Technique A 55-year-old woman was brought to the emergency department with a rapid onset of pain in her upper back and both legs with weakness of her lower extremities. An urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the whole spine showed a SEH. During the operation, after T2 laminectomy, a thin soft catheter was epidurally placed under the T1 lamina and gently pushed forward rostrally. Then continuous saline irrigation was utilized and aspiration made via the catheter to wash out the hematoma. Drainage of blood was observed. The procedure was performed for 15 minutes. Then the catheter was epidurally placed under the T3 lamina, and the procedure for the hematoma in the lower segment was repeated. Decompression of spinal cord and nerve roots was observed. Result Postoperative early MRI of the thoracic-cervical spine showed gross total evacuation of the SEH. Accordingly, the patient's muscle strength improved. Conclusion Although multiple laminectomy or hemilaminectomy for affected levels to evacuate the hematoma and decompress the spinal cord is the main choice of surgical treatment, single-level laminectomy and irrigation plus aspiration via a thin soft catheter can be performed successfully with good results in SSEH.",

INTRODUCTION: Spinal epidural hematoma (SEH) is a rare disease that causes cord compression and neurologic deficit. Spontaneous SEH is related to minor trauma, bleeding disorders, and anticoagulant medications. Posttraumatic SEH has been associated with low-energy spine hyperextension injuries in patients with ankylosing spinal disorders such as ankylosing spondylitis and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH). A variant named atypical DISH-like with SEH is reported. OBJECTIVE: To describe the management, diagnosis, and treatment of an unusual SEH case in a patient causing delayed neurologic deficit with rigid atypical DISH-like spine. CASE DESCRIPTION: An elderly woman with prior antiplatelet therapy presented with delayed neurological deficit suffering trauma after falling. Computed tomography (CT) imaging studies reveal hyperextension fracture pattern and signs mimic DISH missed on standard X-ray images. Magnetic resonance (MR) study demonstrates posterior epidural mass compatible with SEH in thoracic spine with cord compression. Using a midline posterior approach, an urgent intervention and a left multiple partial unilateral decompressive laminectomy at T4-T7 and a long instrumented fusion at T3-T9 were performed for achieving spinal stability and neurological improvement, both of which were observed. CONCLUSION: Patients with rigid spine who sustain low-energy injuries may be prone to have a fracture and epidural hematoma, especially if they take anticoagulant medications. Imaging studies including MR and CT scans should be reviewed carefully to rule out any occult fracture. Urgent or early surgical hematoma drainage and instrumented fusion must be performed to achieve stability and functional recovery.",

Seventy-four patients with DBA from across Canada were included. Nucleotide-level mutations or large deletions were identified in 10 ribosomal genes in 45 cases. The RPS19 mutation group was associated with higher requirement for chronic treatment for anemia than other DBA groups. Patients with RPS19 mutations, however, were more likely to maintain long-term corticosteroid response without requirement for further chronic transfusions. Conversely, patients with RPL11 mutations were less likely to need chronic treatment. Birth defects, including cardiac, skeletal, hand, cleft lip or palate and genitourinary malformations, also varied among the various genetic groups. Patients with RPS19 mutations had the fewest number of defects, while patients with RPL5 had the greatest number of birth defects. This is the first study to show differences between DBA genetic groups with regards to treatment. Previously unreported differences in the rate and types of birth defects were also identified.

Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) is an inherited erythroblastopenia associated with mutations in at least 8 different ribosomal protein genes. Mutations in the gene encoding ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) have been identified in approximately 25% of DBA families. Most of these mutations disrupt either the translation or stability of the RPS19 protein and are predicted to cause DBA by haploinsufficiency. However, approximately 30% of RPS19 mutations are missense mutations that do not alter the stability of the RPS19 protein and are hypothesized to act by a dominant negative mechanism. To formally test this hypothesis, we generated a transgenic mouse model expressing an RPS19 mutation in which an arginine residue is replaced with a tryptophan residue at codon 62 (RPS19R62W). Constitutive expression of RPS19R62W in developing mice was lethal. Conditional expression of RPS19R62W resulted in growth retardation, a mild anemia with reduced numbers of erythroid progenitors, and significant inhibition of terminal erythroid maturation, similar to DBA. RNA profiling demonstrated more than 700 dysregulated genes belonging to the same pathways that are disrupted in RNA profiles of DBA patient cells.

Since some patients with DBA develop a reduction in thrombocytes and granulocytes with age, we asked whether multipotent hematopoietic progenitors from DBA patients had normal proliferative capacity in liquid expansion cultures. CD34(+) cells derived from DBA patients showed deficient proliferation in liquid culture containing IL-3, IL-6, and SCF. Single CD34(+) CD38(-) cells from DBA patients exhibited deficient proliferation recruitment in a limiting dilution assay containing IL-3, IL-6, SCF, Tpo, FL, and G-CSF or containing IL-3, IL-6, and SCF. Our findings suggest that the underlying hematopoietic defect in DBA may not be limited to the erythroid lineage. Since a fraction of DBA patients have a deficiency in ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19), we constructed lentiviral vectors containing the RPS19 gene for overexpression in hematopoietic progenitors from RPS19-deficient DBA patients. Enforced expression of the RPS19 transgene improved the proliferation of CD34(+) cells from DBA patients with RPS19 mutation. Similarly, enforced expression of RPS19 improved erythroid development of RPS19-deficient hematopoietic progenitors as determined by colony assays and erythroid differentiation cultures.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare congenital pure red cell aplasia characterized by normochromic macrocytic anemia, reticulocytopenia, and normocellular bone marrow with a selective deficiency of erythroid precursors. Ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19), currently the only gene associated with DBA, is mutated in 25% of DBA patients, but its role in erythropoiesis is unknown. We attempted to elucidate the importance of RPS19 in translation in relation to the pathogenesis of DBA. DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured translation and proliferation rates in unstimulated and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocytes isolated from DBA patients, as well as in K562 cells expressing several RPS19 mutants to directly test the effect of RPS19 mutations on translation. The effect of leucine on overall translation was also studied. RESULTS: We found that the level of translation was on average 48-73% of controls in both unstimulated and PHA-activated DBA lymphocytes irrespective of mutations in RPS19. The addition of leucine increased the translational level in RPS19-non-mutated DBA cells, but not in cells with an RPS19 mutation. In unstimulated DBA cells, proliferation was significantly impaired in both RPS19-mutated and non-mutated cells, but in both groups could be efficiently activated by PHA. Studies on K562 cells showed that RPS19 mutations affecting RPS19 conserved arginines R56Q and R62Q could significantly inhibit the rate of protein synthesis, indicating the importance of RPS19 in translation. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that inefficient translation may be the main cause of DBA, and administration of leucine may be beneficial for at least some DBA patients.",

Surgery was performed in patients with severe electrodiagnostic CTS findings, CTS duration >1 year and flattening along with hypervascularization in median nerve. All patients were assessed by visual analog scale, two-point discrimination test as well as subjective and objective findings at baseline and on the months 1, 3, and 6 after surgery. RESULTS: The mean age was 58.3 years (42-75 years) in 38 patients who underwent an epineurectomy, whereas it was 61.5 years (41-82 years) in 34 patients who did not have an epineurectomy. The groups were similar with regard to age, gender, duration of symptoms, and preoperative physical findings. Mean visual analog scale (VAS) scores were 1.7 in Group A and 1.8 in Group B. Again, these differences were not significant, on physical examination, the average two-point discrimination in the distribution of the median nerve was 4.9 mm (range: 3-11 mm) in Group A and 5.3 mm (range: 3-10 mm) in Group B.

Both healthy individuals and those diagnosed with CTS participated, all were small convenience samples. Ultrasonographic measurements of the median nerve were reliable in the four studies reporting this, and the studies demonstrated high quality. Conclusions: Good-quality evidence as identified by the EBLIP appraisal checklist suggests that following hand activity, the median nerve changes in size in the carpal tunnel.

In metazoans, the nuclear lamina is thought to play an important role in the spatial organization of interphase chromosomes, by providing anchoring sites for large genomic segments named lamina-associated domains (LADs). Some of these LADs are cell-type specific, while many others appear constitutively associated with the lamina. Constitutive LADs (cLADs) may contribute to a basal chromosome architecture. By comparison of mouse and human lamina interaction maps, we find that the sizes and genomic positions of cLADs are strongly conserved. Moreover, cLADs are depleted of synteny breakpoints, pointing to evolutionary selective pressure to keep cLADs intact. Paradoxically, the overall sequence conservation is low for cLADs. Instead, cLADs are universally characterized by long stretches of DNA of high A/T content. Cell-type specific LADs also tend to adhere to this \"A/T rule\" in embryonic stem cells, but not in differentiated cells. This suggests that the A/T rule represents a default positioning mechanism that is locally overruled during lineage commitment. Analysis of paralogs suggests that during evolution changes in A/T content have driven the relocation of genes to and from the nuclear lamina, in tight association with changes in expression level.

In the previous study, we generated a rat model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) induced by adriamycin and found that the expression of lncRNA H19 was significantly upregulated in myocardial tissue. The present study was aimed to investigate the potential role of H19 in the pathogenesis of adriamycin-induced DCM. H19 knockdown in the myocardium of DCM rats attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis and improved left ventricular structure and function. Adriamycin treatment was associated with elevated H19 and miR-675 expression and increased apoptosis in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Enforced expression of miR-675 was found to induce apoptosis in cardiomyocytes with adriamycin treatment and H19-siRNA transfection. The 3'-untranslated region of PA2G4 was cloned downstream of a luciferase reporter construct and cotransfected into HEK293 cells with miR-675 mimic. The results of luciferase assay showed that PA2G4 was a direct target of miR-675. The expression of PA2G4 was reduced in cardiomyocytes transfected with miR-675 mimic. Moreover, H19 knockdown was found to increase PA2G4 expression and suppress apoptosis in cardiomyocytes exposed to adriamycin. In conclusion, our study suggests that H19/miR-675 axis is involved in the promotion of cardiomyocyte apoptosis by targeting PA2G4, which may provide a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of adriamycin-induced DCM.",

A principal component in the protein coats of certain post-golgi and endocytic vesicles is clathrin, which appears as a three-legged heteropolymer (known as a triskelion) that assembles into polyhedral cages principally made up of pentagonal and hexagonal faces. In vitro, this assembly depends upon the pH, with cages forming more readily at low pH and less readily at high pH. We have developed procedures, on the basis of static and dynamic light scattering, to determine the radius of gyration, R(g), and hydrodynamic radius, R(H), of isolated triskelia, under conditions where cage assembly occurs. Calculations based on rigid molecular bead models of a triskelion show that the measured values can be accounted for by bending the legs and a puckering at the vertex. We also show that the values of R(g) and R(H) measured for clathrin triskelia in solution are qualitatively consistent with the conformation of a triskelion in a \"D6 barrel\" cage assembly measured by cryoelectron microscopy.",

Recent static light scattering and dynamic light scattering studies of triskelia in solution showed that an individual triskelion has an intrinsic pucker similar to, but differing from, that inferred from a high resolution cryoEM structure of a triskelion in a clathrin basket. We extend the earlier solution studies by performing small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments on isolated triskelia, allowing us to examine a higher q range than that probed by static light scattering. Results of the SANS measurements are consistent with the light scattering measurements, but show a shoulder in the scattering function at intermediate q values (0.016 A(-1)), just beyond the Guinier regime. This feature can be accounted for by Brownian dynamics simulations based on flexible bead-spring models of a triskelion, which generate time-averaged scattering functions.

BACKGROUND: Signaling by transmembrane receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) occurs at the cell surface and throughout the endocytic pathway, and signaling from the cell surface may differ in magnitude and downstream output from intracellular signaling. As a result, the rate at which signaling molecules traverse the endocytic pathway makes a significant contribution to downstream output. Modulation of the core endocytic machinery facilitates differential uptake of individual cargoes. Clathrin-coated pits are a major entry portal where assembled clathrin forms a lattice around invaginating buds that have captured endocytic cargo. Clathrin assembles into triskelia composed of three clathrin heavy chains and associated clathrin light chains (CLCs). Despite the identification of clathrin-coated pits at the cell surface over 30 years ago, the functions of CLCs in endocytosis have been elusive. RESULTS: In this work, we identify a novel role for CLCs in the regulated endocytosis of specific cargoes. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of either CLCa or CLCb inhibits the uptake of GPCRs. Moreover, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser204 in CLCb is required for efficient endocytosis of a subset of GPCRs and identify G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) as a kinase that can phosphorylate CLCb on Ser204. Overexpression of CLCb(S204A) specifically inhibits the endocytosis of those GPCRs whose endocytosis is GRK2-dependent. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results indicate that CLCb phosphorylation acts as a discriminator for the endocytosis of specific GPCRs.",

Thermogenesis is an important homeostatic mechanism essential for survival and normal physiological functions in mammals. Both brown adipose tissue (BAT) (i.e. uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-based) and skeletal muscle (i.e. sarcolipin (SLN)-based) thermogenesis processes play important roles in temperature homeostasis, but their relative contributions differ from small to large mammals. In this study, we investigated the functional interplay between skeletal muscle- and BAT-based thermogenesis under mild versus severe cold adaptation by employing UCP1 and SLN mice. Interestingly, adaptation of SLN mice to mild cold conditions (16 \u00b0C) significantly increased UCP1 expression, suggesting increased reliance on BAT-based thermogenesis. This was also evident from structural alterations in BAT morphology, including mitochondrial architecture, increased expression of electron transport chain proteins, and depletion of fat droplets. Similarly, UCP1 mice adapted to mild cold up-regulated muscle-based thermogenesis, indicated by increases in muscle succinate dehydrogenase activity, SLN expression, mitochondrial content, and neovascularization, compared with WT mice. These results further confirm that SLN-based thermogenesis is a key player in muscle non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) and can compensate for loss of BAT activity. We also present evidence that the increased reliance on BAT-based NST depends on increased autonomic input, as indicated by abundant levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and neuropeptide Y. Our findings demonstrate that both BAT and muscle-based NST are equally recruited during mild and severe cold adaptation and that loss of heat production from one thermogenic pathway leads to increased recruitment of the other, indicating a functional interplay between these two thermogenic processes.",

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Non-shivering thermogenesis in adipose tissue can be activated by excessive energy intake or following cold exposure. The molecular mechanisms regulating this activation have not been fully elucidated. The Janus kinase (JAK) - signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway mediates the signal transduction of numerous hormones and growth factors that regulate adipose tissue development and function, and may play a role in adaptive thermogenesis. METHODS: We analysed mRNA and protein levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and JAK2 in different adipose depots in response to metabolic and thermal stress. The in vivo role of JAK2 in adaptive thermogenesis was examined using mice with adipocyte-specific Jak2 deficiency (A-Jak2 KO). RESULTS: We show in murine brown adipose tissue (BAT) that JAK2 is upregulated together with UCP1 in response to high-fat diet (HFD) feeding and cold exposure. In contrast to white adipose tissue, where JAK2 was dispensable for UCP1 induction, we identified an essential role for BAT JAK2 in diet- and cold-induced thermogenesis via mediating the thermogenic response to \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation. Accordingly, A-Jak2 KO mice were unable to upregulate BAT UCP1 following a HFD or after cold exposure. Therefore, A-Jak2 KO mice were cold intolerant and susceptible to HFD-induced obesity and diabetes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Taken together, our results suggest that JAK2 plays a critical role in BAT function and adaptive thermogenesis. Targeting the JAK-STAT pathway may be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders.",

The recent discovery that adult humans have metabolically active BAT has rekindled an interest in this intriguing tissue, with the overarching aim of manipulating BAT function to augment energy expenditure as a countermeasure for obesity and the metabolic abnormalities it incurs. Subsequently, there has been heightened interest in quantifying BAT function and more specifically, determining UCP1-mediated thermogenesis in BAT specimens - including in those obtained from humans. In this article, BAT mitochondrial bioenergetics will be described and compared with more conventional mitochondria in other tissues. The biochemical methods typically used to quantify BAT mitochondrial function will also be discussed in terms of their specificity for assaying UCP1 mediated thermogenesis.

Using single-cell transcriptomics, we confirmed the presence of mRNAs encoding traditional BAT markers (i.e., UCP1, expressed in 100% of BAs Adrb3, expressed in <50% of BAs) in mouse and have shown single-cell variability (>1000-fold) in their expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. We further identified mRNAs encoding novel markers, orphan GPCRs, and many receptors that bind the classic neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, chemokines, cytokines, and hormones. The transcriptome variability between BAs suggests a much larger range of responsiveness of BAT than previously recognized and that not all BAs function identically. We examined the in vivo functional expression of 12 selected receptors by microinjecting agonists into live mouse BAT and analyzing the metabolic response. In this manner, we expanded the number of known receptors on BAs at least 25-fold, while showing that the expression of classic BA markers is more complex and variable than previously thought.",

Because UCP3 properties regarding transport of protons are qualitatively identical to those of UCP1, its expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT) alongside UCP1 requires justification. In this work, we tested whether any correlation exists between the expression of UCP1 and UCP3 in BAT by quantification of protein amounts in mouse tissues at physiological conditions, in cold-acclimated and UCP1 knockout mice. Quantification using recombinant UCP3 revealed that the UCP3 amount in BAT (0.51ng/(\u03bcg total tissue protein)) was nearly one order of magnitude higher than that in muscles and heart. Cold-acclimated mice showed an approximate three-fold increase in UCP3 abundance in BAT in comparison to mice in thermoneutral conditions. Surprisingly, we found a significant decrease of UCP3 in BAT of UCP1 knockout mice, whereas the protein amount in skeletal and heart muscles remained constant. UCP3 abundance decreased even more in cold-acclimated UCP1 knockout mice. Protein quantification in UCP3 knockout mice revealed no compensatory increase in UCP1 or UCP2 expression. Our results do not support the participation of UCP3 in thermogenesis in the absence of UCP1 in BAT, but clearly demonstrate the correlation in abundance between both proteins.

Neither mast cells nor basophils participated in the immune response to tissue-migrating Strongyloides ratti third-stage larvae, but both cell types contributed to the early expulsion of parasitic adults from the intestine.

METHODS: Intestinal biopsy specimens of patients with CD were scored according to the Marsh classification and characterized for leukocyte infiltration and MC distribution. Moreover, MC reactivity to gliadin and its peptides was characterized by using in\u00a0vitro assays. RESULTS: Infiltrating MCs were associated with the severity of mucosal damage, and their numbers were increased in patients with higher Marsh scores. MCs were found to directly respond to nonimmunodominant gliadin fragments by releasing proinflammatory mediators. Immunohistochemical characterization of infiltrating MCs and the effects of gliadin peptides on intestinal MCs indicated an increase in proinflammatory MC function in advanced stages of the disease. This was also associated with increased neutrophil accumulation, the prevalence of M1 macrophages, and the severity of tissue damage. CONCLUSION: We provide a description of the progressive stages of CD, in which MCs are the hallmark of the inflammatory process.

METHODS: Bone marrow-derived cultured mast cells (BMCMCs) and peritoneal cell-derived mast cells were used as \"surrogates\" for mucosal and connective tissue mast cells, respectively, and their releasate proteomes were analyzed by mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Our studies showed that BMCMCs and peritoneal cell-derived mast cells produced substantially different releasates following IgE-mediated activation. Moreover, we observed that the transglutaminase coagulation factor XIIIA (FXIIIA) was one of the most abundant proteins contained in the BMCMC releasates. Mast cell-deficient mice exhibited increased FXIIIA plasma and activity levels as well as reduced bleeding times, indicating that mast cells are more efficient in their ability to downregulate FXIIIA than in contributing to its amounts and functions in homeostatic conditions.

METHODS: Coronary arteries were obtained at autopsy from patients with acute MI (up to 5 days old; n=27) and with chronic MI (5-14 days old; n=18), as well as sections from controls without cardiac disease (n=10). Herein, tryptase-positive MCs were quantified in the intima and media of both unstable and stable atherosclerotic plaques in infarct-related and non-infarct-related coronary arteries. RESULTS: In the media of both acute and chronic MI patients, the number of MCs was significantly higher than in controls. This was also found when evaluating unstable and stable plaques separately. In patients with chronic MI, the number of MCs in unstable lesions was significantly higher than in stable lesions. This coincided with a significant increase in the relative number of unstable plaques in patients with chronic MI compared with control and acute MI. No differences in MC density were found between infarct-related and non-infarct-related coronary arteries in patients with MI. CONCLUSION: The presence of MCs in the media of both stable and unstable atherosclerotic coronary lesions after MI suggests that MCs may be involved in the onset of MI and, on the other hand, that MI triggers intra-plaque infiltration of MCs especially in unstable plaques, possibly increasing the risk of re-infarction.",

Except for the absence of significant inflammation the histopathology is similar to that found in sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM). In s-IBM mitochondrial alterations including cytochrome c oxidase (COX) -deficient muscle fibers are common. These are due to multiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions. In this study we investigated the occurrence of mitochondrial alterations in autosomal dominant h-IBM. Young affected individuals showed no mitochondrial changes but three patients aged 38, 51 and 59 years, respectively, showed ragged red fibers and COX-deficient muscle fibers. Polymerase chain reaction analysis showed multiple mtDNA deletions. By in situ hybridization clonal expansions of mtDNA with deletions were demonstrated in COX-deficient muscle fibers. Most of the analyzed deletion breakpoints showed nucleotide repeats flanking the deletions. The results show that COX-deficient muscle fibers and somatic mtDNA deletions are present in this family with h-IBM. The same factors may be involved in the development of mtDNA deletions in s-IBM and this family with h-IBM.",

Mitochondrial DNA deletions are prominent in human genetic disorders, cancer, and aging. It is thought that stalling of the mitochondrial replication machinery during DNA synthesis is a prominent source of mitochondrial genome instability; however, the precise molecular determinants of defective mitochondrial replication are not well understood. In this work, we performed a computational analysis of the human mitochondrial genome using the \"Pattern Finder\" G-quadruplex (G4) predictor algorithm to assess whether G4-forming sequences reside in close proximity (within 20 base pairs) to known mitochondrial DNA deletion breakpoints. We then used this information to map G4P sequences with deletions characteristic of representative mitochondrial genetic disorders and also those identified in various cancers and aging. Circular dichroism and UV spectral analysis demonstrated that mitochondrial G-rich sequences near deletion breakpoints prevalent in human disease form G-quadruplex DNA structures. A biochemical analysis of purified recombinant human Twinkle protein (gene product of c10orf2) showed that the mitochondrial replicative helicase inefficiently unwinds well characterized intermolecular and intramolecular G-quadruplex DNA substrates, as well as a unimolecular G4 substrate derived from a mitochondrial sequence that nests a deletion breakpoint described in human renal cell carcinoma. Although G4 has been implicated in the initiation of mitochondrial DNA replication, our current findings suggest that mitochondrial G-quadruplexes are also likely to be a source of instability for the mitochondrial genome by perturbing the normal progression of the mitochondrial replication machinery, including DNA unwinding by Twinkle helicase.",

In this study, we have characterized 13 mtDNA deletion breakpoints from skeletal muscle harvested from 9- to 27-year-old rhesus monkeys. Seven of the deletions, five of which were unique to a particular animal, did not have direct repeats at the deletion breakpoints. In contrast, two of the three deletions common to several animals had direct repeats flanking the breakpoints. It appears, therefore, that at least two different mechanisms exist by which mtDNA deletions are formed during aging, one requiring and one independent of flanking direct repeats.

BACKGROUND: Minors with a stated age <18 years unaccompanied by a responsible adult form an increasing part of refugees to Europe. They are older than other asylum-seeking children and many come from countries with a high tuberculosis (TB) incidence. During the 2015 refugee crisis, 35,369 of 162,877 refugees (22%) seeking asylum in Sweden were unaccompanied minors, which gave us the opportunity to study their burden of TB infection and disease. METHODS: Of the unaccompanied minors seeking asylum in Sweden during 2015, 2936 (8.3%) were allocated to northern Stockholm. Of these, 2422 were from countries with an incidence of TB exceeding 100/10, and were screened for TB infection with a Mantoux tuberculin skin test or a QuantiFERON-TB Gold\u00ae. Those from countries with a lower TB incidence were screened only if they had other risk factors for TB exposure. RESULTS: Of those screened, 349 had a positive test and were referred to the northern paediatric TB clinic at Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital. Of these, 16 had TB disease and 278 latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), while we considered 53 uninfected. In addition, eight sought medical attention with symptomatic TB outside the screening system. Cohort rates were 6.8% of LTBI and 0.5% of TB in minors from Afghanistan and 26-32% of LTBI and 3.4-3.5% of TB among those from Eritrea, Ethiopia or Somalia. CONCLUSION: We conclude that TB infection and disease is common among asylum-seeking unaccompanied minors, especially among those from the Horn of Africa.",

Tuberculin skin test (TST) is widely used although it suffers of low specificity; on the contrary, the in vitro enzyme immunoassay tests (IGRA) show superior specificity and sensitivity but are more expensive. The present study reports the results of a three-year TB surveillance among HCW in a large teaching hospital in Rome, using TST (by standard Mantoux technique) and IGRA (by QuantiFERON-TB) as first- and second-level screening tests, respectively. Out of 2290 HCW enrolled, 141 (6.1%) had a positive TST; among them, 99 (70.2%) underwent the IGRA and 16 tested positive (16.1%). The frequency of HCW tested positive for TB seems not far from other experiences in low incidence countries. Our results confirm the higher specificity of IGRA, but, due to its higher cost, TST can be considered a good first level screening test, whose positive results should be further confirmed by IGRA before the patients undergo X-ray diagnosis and/or chemotherapy.",

However active, prompt and accurate diagnosis is the key element in the public health response to tuberculosis and the cornerstone of tuberculosis control. Different diagnostic methods for an assured diagnosis of TB are necessary. Chest radiography is a useful keystone to identify tuberculosis, but diagnosis of tuberculosis cannot be established by radiography alone. CT scanning is used in patients without pathological chest radiography but clinically suspected active TB and to differentiate TB from other diseases. Radiological appearance is primarily determined by the immune status of patients and caverns and disseminated disease foci are often observed. Laboratory diagnostic methods include microscopic identification of acid-fast mycobacteria from any body fluid (especially sputum), as well as isolation and characterisation of mycobacteria in culture. It is then possible to type the pathogens by the shape of their colony, their growth behavior and their biochemical characteristics. These methods are regarded as the gold standard in diagnosis of active TB. In patients who are highly suspected of having TB, but whose sputum specimens tested negative for mycobacteria, a nucleic acid amplification test is additionally performed. Moreover, sensitivity testing with first and second line antitubercular drugs is applied as standard. Laboratory diagnostic testing of cellular immunity against pathogenic mycobacteria employs the tuberculin skin test (TST, Mantoux tuberculin test) or the more specific interferon \u03b3 test to determine \u03b3 interferon released by T lymphocytes stimulated in vitro. The new ELISA and ELISPOT procedures exhibit higher test specificity and less cross reactivity to NTM (non-tuberculosis mycobacteria), are independent of BCG-vaccination status and correlate better with the degree of exposure than does the TST.",

METHODS: Data were obtained from the Psocare Registry on those patients (n\u00a0=\u00a04946) with age >\u00a018\u00a0years, systemic treatment at entry specified and tuberculin skin test (TST) performed according to the Mantoux method. LTBI diagnosis was based on a positive TST result in the absence of any clinical, radiological or microbiological evidence of active tuberculosis. RESULTS: Latent tuberculosis infection was diagnosed in 8\u00b73% of patients with psoriasis (409 of 4946). The prevalence of LTBI was lower in patients on biologics than in those on conventional systemic treatments, ranging from 4\u00b73% (19 of 444) of patients on adalimumab to 31% (eight of 26) of those on psoralen-ultraviolet A (P\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b705).

OBJECTIVE: To study the expression of EpCAM and E-cadherin in papillary thyroid carcinoma and to analyze its correlation with various clinicopathologic parameters. METHODS: Immunohistochemical study for EpCAM and E-cadherin was carried out in 91 cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Twenty-four cases of papillary hyperplasia of thyroid were used as controls. RESULTS: In all of the 24 cases of papillary hyperplasia, EpCAM was located on the cell membrane, while in the 91 cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma studied, EpCAM was located within the cytoplasm, with 36.3% (33/91) showing nuclear localization as well. In all the papillary hyperplasia cases studied, E-cadherin showed membranous expression. E-cadherin expression was reduced in 84.6% (77/91) of papillary thyroid carcinoma, as compared with the surrounding native thyroid parenchyma. Amongst the 33 cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma which showed nuclear localization of EpCAM, 30 cases also showed reduced E-cadherin expression. There was a positive correlation between nuclear expression of EpCAM and loss of E-cadherin expression (P = 0.000; Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.857). Nuclear expression of EpCAM correlated with follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma and presence of extrathyroidal extension ( P = 0.037 and 0.033, respectively). Loss of E-cadherin expression correlated with age of patients and presence of lymph node metastasis (P = 0.018 and 0.010, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: E-cadherin expression is reduced in papillary thyroid carcinoma, as compared with native thyroid parenchyma and papillary hyperplasia. Papillary thyroid carcinoma shows loss of EpCAM membranous expression and increased cytoplasmic/nuclear accumulation.

BACKGROUND: Autotransplantation of frozen-thawed ovarian tissue is a method to preserve ovarian function and fertility in patients undergoing gonadotoxic therapy. In oncology patients, the safety cannot yet be guaranteed, since current tumor detection methods can only exclude the presence of malignant cells in ovarian fragments that are not transplanted. We determined the need for a novel detection method by studying the distribution of tumor cells in ovaries from patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, we examined which cell-surface proteins are suitable as a target for non-invasive tumor-specific imaging of ovarian metastases from invasive breast cancer. METHODS: Using the nationwide database of the Dutch Pathology Registry (PALGA), we identified a cohort of 46 women with primary invasive breast cancer and ovarian metastases. The localization and morphology of ovarian metastases were determined on hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections. The following cell-surface markers were immunohistochemically analyzed: E-cadherin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), human epidermal growth receptor type 2 (Her2/neu), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), \u03b1v\u03b26 integrin and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). RESULTS: The majority of ovarian metastases (71%) consisted of a solitary metastasis or multiple distinct nodules separated by uninvolved ovarian tissue, suggesting that ovarian metastases might be overlooked by the current detection approach. Combining the targets E-cadherin, EMA and Her2/neu resulted in nearly 100% detection of ductal ovarian metastases, whereas the combination of EMA, Her2/neu and EpCAM was most suitable to detect lobular ovarian metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Examination of the actual ovarian transplants is recommended. A combination of targets is most appropriate to detect ovarian metastases by tumor-specific imaging.",

Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a transmembrane glycoprotein, which is frequently and highly expressed on carcinomas, tumor-initiating cells, selected tissue progenitors, and embryonic and adult stem cells. During liver development, EpCAM demonstrates a dynamic expression, since it can be detected in fetal liver, including cells of the parenchyma, whereas mature hepatocytes are devoid of EpCAM. Liver regeneration is associated with a population of EpCAM-positive cells within ductular reactions, which gradually lose the expression of EpCAM along with maturation into hepatocytes. EpCAM can be switched on and off through a wide panel of strategies to fine-tune EpCAM-dependent functional and differentiative traits. EpCAM-associated functions relate to cell-cell adhesion, proliferation, maintenance of a pluripotent state, regulation of differentiation, migration, and invasion. These functions can be conferred by the full-length protein and/or EpCAM-derived fragments, which are generated upon regulated intramembrane proteolysis. Control by EpCAM therefore not only depends on the presence of full-length EpCAM at cellular membranes but also on varying rates of the formation of EpCAM-derived fragments that have their own regulatory properties and on changes in the association of EpCAM with interaction partners. Thus spatiotemporal localization of EpCAM in immature liver progenitors, transit-amplifying cells, and mature liver cells will decisively impact the regulation of EpCAM functions and might be one of the triggers that contributes to the adaptive processes in stem/progenitor cell lineages. This review will summarize EpCAM-related molecular events and how they relate to hepatobiliary differentiation and regeneration.",

Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) has been discovered as one of the first tumor-specific antigens overexpressed in epithelial cancer. The present review focuses on the role of EpCAM in physiology and homeostasis of epithelia. Recent research pointed to a close interaction of EpCAM with other cell-cell contact molecules like E-cadherin and claudins and an intimate crosstalk with Wnt and TGF-beta signaling in the regulation of cell growth. Moreover, EpCAM has been shown to modulate trans-epithelial migration processes of white blood cells. Mutations of the EpCAM gene lead to disturbances of epithelial homeostasis and cellular differentiation from the stem cell compartment. In the intestinal tract EpCAM mutations contribute to congenital tufting enteropathy. Regarding tumorigenesis EpCAM can act as an oncogene still depending on additional driver mutations and epithelial phenotype of tumor cells. Tumor cells display increased EpCAM expression that often correlates with the loss of strict basolateral localization. Many tumors show enhanced regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of EpCAM and loose EpCAM expression under conditions of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The resulting extracellular EpEX and intracellular EpICD fragments mediate proliferative signals to the cell. Resulting fragments can be validated either by sensitive enzyme-linked immune-sandwich assays (EpEX) or by immunohistochemistry (EpICD).

EpCAM accumulated on the lateral interfaces of human colon carcinoma and normal intestinal epithelial cells but did not co-localize with TJ. Knockdown of EpCAM in T84 and Caco-2 cells using shRNAs led to changes in morphology and adhesiveness. TJ formed readily after EpCAM knockdown; the acquisition of trans-epithelial electroresistance was enhanced, and TJ showed increased resistance to disruption by calcium chelation. Preparative immunoprecipitation demonstrated that EpCAM bound tightly to claudin-7. Co-immunoprecipitation documented associations of EpCAM with claudin-7 and claudin-1 but not claudin-2 or claudin-4. Claudin-1 associated with claudin-7 in co-transfection experiments, and claudin-7 was required for association of claudin-1 with EpCAM. EpCAM knockdown resulted in decreases in claudin-7 and claudin-1 proteins that were reversed with lysosome inhibitors. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that claudin-7 and claudin-1 continually trafficked into lysosomes. Although EpCAM knockdown decreased claudin-1 and claudin-7 protein levels overall, accumulations of claudin-1 and claudin-7 in TJ increased.

We suggest that quantification is essential to understand basic biological relationships between exosomes and their parent cells and hence the underlying interpretation of exosome signals. The number of methods for quantifying exosomes has expanded as interest in exosomes has increased. However, a consensus on proper quantification has not developed, making each study difficult to compare to another. Overcoming this ad hoc approach will require widely available standards that have been adequately characterized, and multiple comparative studies across platforms.

EVs in biofluids are heterogeneous, coming from different cell types and from different sources with the cell, which limits the usefulness of bulk EV analysis methods that report the average features of all EVs present. Single-particle measurements such as flow cytometry would be preferred, but the small size and low abundance of surface antigens challenges conventional flow cytometry approaches, leading to the development of vesicle-specific assays and experimental design. Among the key issues that have emerged are: (a) judicious choice of detection (triggering) approach; (b) appropriate control experiments to confirm the vesicular nature of the detected events and the contribution of coincidence (aka swarm detection); and (c) the importance of fluorescence calibration to allow data to be compared over time and between laboratories. We illustrate these issues in the context of fluorescence-triggered Vesicle Flow Cytometry (VFC), a general approach to the quantitative measurement of EV number, size, and surface marker expression.",

However, existing models specifically designed for regulatory sequences consider the independent evolution of individual transcription factor (TF)-binding sites, ignoring that the function and evolution of a binding site depends on its context, typically the cis-regulatory module (CRM) in which the site is located. Moreover, existing models do not account for the gene-specific roles of TF-binding sites, primarily because their roles often are not well understood. We introduce two models of regulatory sequence evolution that address some of the shortcomings of existing models and implement simulation frameworks based on them. One model simulates the evolution of an individual binding site in the context of a CRM, while the other evolves an entire CRM. Both models use a state-of-the art sequence-to-expression model to predict the effects of mutations on the regulatory output of the CRM and determine the strength of selection. We use the new framework to simulate the evolution of TF-binding sites in 37 well-studied CRMs belonging to the anterior-posterior patterning system in Drosophila embryos. We show that these simulations provide accurate fits to evolutionary data from 12 Drosophila genomes, which includes statistics of binding site conservation on relatively short evolutionary scales and site loss across larger divergence times. The new framework allows us, for the first time, to test hypotheses regarding the underlying cis-regulatory code by directly comparing the evolutionary implications of the hypothesis with the observed evolutionary dynamics of binding sites. Using this capability, we find that explicitly modeling self-cooperative DNA binding by the TF Caudal (CAD) provides significantly better fits than an otherwise identical evolutionary simulation that lacks this mechanistic aspect. This hypothesis is further supported by a statistical analysis of the distribution of intersite spacing between adjacent CAD sites. Experimental tests confirm direct homodimeric interaction between CAD molecules as well as self-cooperative DNA binding by CAD. We note that computational modeling of the D. melanogaster CRMs alone did not yield significant evidence to support CAD self-cooperativity. We thus demonstrate how specific mechanistic details encoded in CRMs can be revealed by modeling their evolution and fitting such models to multispecies data.",

Previous studies have shown that mice lacking the dopamine D3 receptor (D3RKO) exhibit hypoalgesia, indicating a role of the D3 receptor in modulation of nociception. Given that there are sex differences in pain perception, there may be differences in responses to nociceptive stimuli between male and female D3RKO mice. In the current study, we examined the role of the D3 receptor in modulating nociception in male and female D3RKO mice. Acute thermal pain was modeled by hot-plate test. This test was performed at different temperatures including 52\u00b0C, 55\u00b0C, and 58\u00b0C. The von Frey hair test was applied to evaluate mechanical pain. And persistent pain produced by peripheral tissue injury and inflammation was modeled by formalin test. In the hot-plate test, compared with wild-type (WT) mice, D3RKO mice generally exhibited longer latencies at each of the three temperatures. Specially, male D3RKO mice showed hypoalgesia compared with male WT mice when the temperature was 55\u00b0C, while for the female mice, there was a statistical difference between genotypes when the test condition was 52\u00b0C. In the von Frey hair test, both male and female D3RKO mice exhibited hypoalgesia. In the formalin test, the male D3RKO mice displayed a similar nociceptive behavior as their sex-matched WT littermates, whereas significantly depressed late-phase formalin-induced nociceptive behaviors were observed in the female mutants. These findings indicated that the D3 receptor affects nociceptive behaviors in a sex-specific manner and that its absence induces more analgesic behavior in the female knockout mice. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Tapentadol or ketorolac were administered ip 15 min before orofacial formalin injection. The effect of the individual drugs was used to calculate their ED values and different proportions (tapentadol-ketorolac in 1:1, 3:1, and 1:3) were assayed in the orofacial test using isobolographic analysis and interaction index to evaluate the interaction between the drugs.

LOX is overexpressed in the heart and aorta from rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD). \u03b2-Aminopropionitrile (BAPN), an inhibitor of LOX activity, significantly attenuated the increase in body weight and cardiac hypertrophy observed in HFD rats. No significant differences were found in cardiac function or blood pressure among any group. However, HFD rats showed cardiac and vascular fibrosis and enhanced levels of superoxide anion (O2(-)), collagen I and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) in heart and aorta and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in aorta, effects that were attenuated by LOX inhibition. Interestingly, BAPN also prevented the increase in circulating leptin levels detected in HFD fed animals. Leptin increased protein levels of collagen I, TGF-\u03b2 and CTGF, Akt phosphorylation and O2(-) production in both cardiac myofibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells in culture, while LOX inhibition ameliorated these alterations. LOX knockdown also attenuated leptin-induced collagen I production in cardiovascular cells.

Dysregulation of LOXL2 has been linked to many diseases, including cancer, pro-oncogenic angiogenesis, fibrosis and heart diseases. In this review, we will give an overview of the current understandings and hypotheses regarding the molecular functions of LOXL2.",

A key feature of heart failure is adverse extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, which is associated with increases in the collagen cross-linking enzyme, lysyl oxidase (LOX). In this study, we assess the progression of cardiovascular remodeling from the compensatory to decompensatory phase, with a focus on the change in LOX expression and activity as it relates to alterations in ECM composition and changes in cardiac function. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied after 4, 14, or 21weeks of aortocaval fistula-induced volume overload (VO). Progressive increases in the left and right ventricular mass indicated biventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography revealed significant increases in the posterior wall thickness and internal diameter of the left ventricle as early as 3weeks, which persisted until the 21week endpoint. There were also significant decreases in eccentric index and fractional shortening in VO animals. Hemodynamic measurements showed progressive decreases in contractility, indicative of systolic dysfunction. There were progressive VO-induced increases in LOX expression and activity, collagen, and collagen cross-linking during the course of these experiments. We observed a negative correlation between LOX activity and cardiac function. Additional rats were treated with an inhibitor of LOX activity starting at 2weeks post-surgery and continued to 14weeks. LOX inhibition prevented the cardiac dysfunction and collagen accumulation caused by VO. Overall these data suggest a detrimental role for the chronic increase of cardiac LOX expression and activity in the transition from compensated remodeling to decompensated failure.",

Here, we systematically investigated LOX/L expression in primary fibroblasts and epithelial cells under fibrotic conditions, Bleomycin (BLM) induced lung fibrosis and in human IPF tissue. Basal expression of all LOX/L family members was detected in epithelial cells and at higher levels in fibroblasts. Various pro-fibrotic stimuli broadly induced LOX/L expression in fibroblasts, whereas specific induction of LOXL2 and partially LOX was observed in epithelial cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of lung tissue from 14 IPF patients and healthy donors revealed strong induction of LOX and LOXL2 in bronchial and alveolar epithelium as well as fibroblastic foci. Using siRNA experiments we observed that LOXL2 and LOXL3 were crucial for fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT). As FMT could only be reconstituted with an enzymatically active LOXL2 variant, we conclude that LOXL2 enzymatic function is crucial for fibroblast transdifferentiation.

Here, we demonstrated that FOXP2 is clearly defined as a SUMO target protein at the cellular levels as FOXP2 is covalently modified by both SUMO1 and SUMO3. Furthermore, SUMOylation of FOXP2 was significantly decreased by SENP2 (a specific SUMOylation protease). We further showed that FOXP2 is selectively SUMOylated in vivo on a phylogenetically conserved lysine 674 but the SUMOylation does not alter subcellular localization and stability of FOXP2. Interestingly, we observed that human etiological FOXP2 R553H mutation robustly reduces its SUMOylation potential as compared to wild-type FOXP2. In addition, the acidic residues downstream the core SUMO motif on FOXP2 are required for its full SUMOylation capacity. Finally, our functional analysis using reporter gene assays showed that SUMOylation may modulate transcriptional activity of FOXP2 in regulating downstream target genes (DISC1, SRPX2, and MiR200c).

A total of 838 subjects were included in the present study: 453 patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer and 385 subjects with no skin cancer.

Carriers of one variant allele had half the risk. The highest relative risks of nonmelanoma skin cancer were found in carriers of the Asp84Glu, His260Pro, and Asp294His variant alleles, and the risk was only slightly lower for carriers of the Val60Leu, Val92Met, Arg142His, Arg151Cys, and Arg160Trp variant alleles.

Such LOF alleles typically have low frequencies and moderate to large effects. Detecting such variants is of interest to the genetics community, and relevant statistical methods for detecting and quantifying their effects are sorely needed. We present a collapsed double heterozygosity (CDH) test to detect the presence of multiple LOF alleles at a gene.

When causal SNPs are not directly available such as in current GWA settings, we show the CDH test has higher power than standard single SNP analysis if tagging SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium with the underlying causal SNPs to at least a moderate degree (r\u00b2>0.1). The test is implemented for genome-wide analysis in the publically available software package GenABEL which is based on a sliding window approach.

Variant alleles are associated with red hair colour and fair skin, known as the RHC phenotype, as well as skin cancer risk. The R151C, R160W and D294H alleles, designated 'R', are strongly associated with the RHC phenotype and have been proposed to result in loss of function receptors due to impaired G-protein coupling. We recently provided evidence that the R151C and R160W variants can efficiently couple to G-proteins in response to alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone. The possibility that altered cellular localization of the R151C and R160W variant receptors could underlie their association with RHC was therefore considered. Using immunofluorescence and ligand binding studies, we found that melanocytic cells exogenously or endogenously expressing MC1R show strong surface localization of the wild-type and D294H alleles but markedly reduced cell surface expression of the R151C and R160W receptors. In additional exogenous expression studies, the R variant D84E and the rare I155T variant, also demonstrated a significant reduction in plasma membrane receptor numbers. The V60L, V92M and R163Q weakly associated RHC alleles, designated 'r', were expressed with normal or intermediate cell surface receptor levels.

Loss-of-function mutations at the MC1R are associated with a switch from eumelanin to phaeomelanin production, resulting in a red or yellow coat colour. Activating mutations, in animals at least, lead to enhanced eumelanin synthesis. In man, a number of loss-of-function mutations in the MC1R have been described. The majority of red-heads (red-haired persons) are compound heterozygotes or homozygotes for up to five frequent loss-of-function mutations. A minority of redheads are, however, only heterozygote. The MC1R is, therefore, a major determinant of sun sensitivity and a genetic risk factor for melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Recent work suggests that the MC1R also shows a clear heterozygote effect on skin type, with up to 30% of the population harbouring loss-of-function mutations. Activating mutations of the MC1R in man have not been described. The MC1R is particularly informative and a tractable gene for studies of human evolution and migration. In particular, study of the MC1R may provide insights into the lightening of skin colour observed in most European populations. The world wide pattern of MC1R diversity is compatible with functional constraint operating in Africa, whereas the greater allelic diversity seen in non-African populations is consistent with neutral predictions rather than selection.

Eumelanin is photoprotective whereas phaeomelanin, because of its potential to generate free radicals in response to UVR, may contribute to UV-induced skin damage. Individuals with red hair have a predominance of phaeomelain in hair and skin and/or a reduced ability to produce eumelanin, which may explain why they fail to tan and are at risk from UVR. In mammals the relative proportions of phaeomelanin and eumelanin are regulated by melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), which acts via its receptor (MC1R), on melanocytes, to increase the synthesis of eumelanin and the product of the agouti locus which antagonises this action. In mice, mutations at either the MC1R gene or agouti affect the pattern of melanogenesis resulting in changes in coat colour. We now report the presence of MC1R gene sequence variants in humans. These were found in over 80% of individuals with red hair and/or fair skin that tans poorly but in fewer than 20% of individuals with brown or black hair and in less than 4% of those who showed a good tanning response. Our findings suggest that in humans, as in other mammals, the MC1R is a control point in the regulation of pigmentation phenotype and, more importantly, that variations in this protein are associated with a poor tanning response.",

Cutaneous pigmentation is a major determinant of the cutaneous response to ultraviolet radiation, and consequently of the risk of developing skin cancer. Over the past 10 years, several genes involved in melanogenesis have been identified, including the melanocortin 1 receptor gene. Recent work on the melanocortin 1 receptor suggests that it is a key player in determining whether eumelanin or pheomelanin is predominantly produced both in vitro and in vivo. In the mouse, variants of this receptor, which differ in their ability to activate adenylyl cyclase, are associated with different coat colors. In humans, melanocortin 1 receptor variants are associated with red hair and fair skin, and work in progress from our laboratory suggests that certain melanocortin 1 receptor variants may preferentially be associated with hair color rather than skin type. In addition, melanocortin 1 receptor variants are a risk factor, possibly independent of skin type, for melanoma susceptibility.",

The present study aimed to evaluate the distribution of melanocortin 1 receptor gene variants R151C, R160W, and D294H within the Russian population of Eastern Siberia and its association with melanoma development. Melanoma patients (n=95) admitted to Krasnoyarsk Territorial Oncological Center and healthy controls (n=334) were enrolled in the study. A clinical examination of patients was performed to evaluate the phenotypic features of melanoma patients. SNPs were analyzed by real-time PCR. Clinical examination indicated a more frequent occurrence of fair skin type, blue eyes, blonde and red hair, and more frequent localization of freckles on the neck, trunk, and extremities in the melanoma group of patients. The R151C melanocortin 1 receptor gene variant was found in 18% of melanoma patients and associated with an increased likelihood of melanoma development (odds ratio=6.4; 95% confidence interval: 2.8-14.3; P=0.0001). The two remaining variant alleles of the melanocortin 1 receptor gene occurred with low frequency both in controls and in the melanoma group. The R160W SNP was identified neither in controls nor in melanoma patients.

Such an asymmetric distribution of the melanocortin 1 receptor within red hair color genotypes in the population under study compared with other populations may be because of Russian genetic homogeneity.

In the present study, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) diversity among a worldwide collection of contemporary human populations with respect to the genetic constitution of these two archaic hominins and Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee). We partitioned SNPs into subsets, including those that are derived in both archaic lineages, those that are ancestral in both archaic lineages and those that are only derived in one archaic lineage. By doing this, we have conducted separate examinations of subsets of mutations with higher probabilities of divergent phylogenetic origins. While previous investigations have excluded SNPs from common ancestors in principal component analyses, we included common ancestral SNPs in our analyses to visualize the relative placement of the Neanderthal and Denisova among human populations. To assess the genetic similarities among the various hominin lineages, we performed genetic structure analyses to provide a comparison of genetic patterns found within contemporary human genomes that may have archaic or common ancestral roots. Our results indicate that 3.6% of the Neanderthal genome is shared with roughly 65.4% of the average European gene pool, which clinally diminishes with distance from Europe.

If the Neanderthal population was large compared to the Homo sapiens population at the beginning of the contact period, we show that genetic introgression should have been fast and complete meaning that most of the Neanderthal private alleles should be found in the modern human gene pool in case of ancient admixture. In order to test/reject ancient admixture from genome-wide data, we incorporate the model of genetic introgression into a statistical hypothesis-testing framework. We show that the power to reject ancient admixture increases as the ratio, at the time of putative admixture, of the population size of Homo sapiens over that of Neanderthal decreases. We find that the power to reject ancient admixture might be particularly low if the population size of Homo sapiens was comparable to the Neanderthal population size.",

Recent studies have shown that this Neanderthal DNA is depleted around functional genomic regions; this has been suggested to be a consequence of harmful epistatic interactions between human and Neanderthal alleles. However, using published estimates of Neanderthal inbreeding and the distribution of mutational fitness effects, we infer that Neanderthals had at least 40% lower fitness than humans on average; this increased load predicts the reduction in Neanderthal introgression around genes without the need to invoke epistasis. We also predict a residual Neanderthal mutational load in non-Africans, leading to a fitness reduction of at least 0.5%. This effect of Neanderthal admixture has been left out of previous debate on mutation load differences between Africans and non-Africans. We also show that if many deleterious mutations are recessive, the Neanderthal admixture fraction could increase over time due to the protective effect of Neanderthal haplotypes against deleterious alleles that arose recently in the human population. This might partially explain why so many organisms retain gene flow from other species and appear to derive adaptive benefits from introgression.",

Quantifying the strength and causes of this selection against Neanderthal ancestry is key to understanding our relationship to Neanderthals and, more broadly, how populations remain distinct after secondary contact. Here, we develop a novel method for estimating the genome-wide average strength of selection and the density of selected sites using estimates of Neanderthal allele frequency along the genomes of modern-day humans. We confirm that East Asians had somewhat higher initial levels of Neanderthal ancestry than Europeans even after accounting for selection. We find that the bulk of purifying selection against Neanderthal ancestry is best understood as acting on many weakly deleterious alleles. We propose that the majority of these alleles were effectively neutral-and segregating at high frequency-in Neanderthals, but became selected against after entering human populations of much larger effective size. While individually of small effect, these alleles potentially imposed a heavy genetic load on the early-generation human-Neanderthal hybrids.

FINDINGS: MRSA Select II, Colorex MRSA, and ChromID each grew at a density of 1.5 \u00d7 10(1)cfu/mL for each SCCmec type investigated.

Comparing patients based on LN, elevated levels of CSF1, sIL15RA, sCD40, sCX3CL1, caspase 8, sIL18R1, bNGF, and GDNF (P \u00a0<\u00a00.05) were detected in active LN. Except GDNF, all LN-associated markers showed usefulness in prediction of active renal disease. CONCLUSIONS: This highly sensitive PEA analysis identified the serum pattern of SLE, organ damage, and active LN, with many novel candidate proteins detected. Their exact role and suitability as biomarkers in SLE deserve further investigation.",

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) influence diverse cellular processes and may contribute to tumor development and progression by multiple mechanisms. Class I HDACs are often overexpressed in cancers contributing to a genome-wide epigenetic state permitting increased proliferation, and diminished apoptosis and cell differentiation. Class IIA and IIB isoenzymes may likewise contribute to tumorigenesis as components of specific intranuclear repressor complexes or regulators of posttranslational protein modifications. As HDAC inhibitors may counteract these tumorigenic effects several of these compounds are currently tested in clinical trials. HDAC inhibitors are also considered for urothelial carcinoma, where novel therapeutic drugs are urgently required. However, only modest antineoplastic activity has been observed with isoenzyme-unspecific pan-HDAC inhibitors. Therefore, inhibition of specific HDAC isoenzymes might be more efficacious and tumor-specific. Here, we systematically review knowledge on the expression, function and suitability as therapeutic targets of the 11 classical HDACs in UC. Overall, the class I HDACs HDAC1 and HDAC2 are the most promising targets for antineoplastic treatment. In contrast, targeting HDAC8 and HDAC6 is likely to be of minor relevance in urothelial carcinoma. Class IIA HDACs like HDAC4 require further study, since their downregulation rather than upregulation could be involved in urothelial carcinoma pathogenesis.",

Pol \u03b8 is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol \u03b8 is important in the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by CRISPR-Cas9. Pol \u03b8 participates in a route of DSB repair termed \"alternative end-joining\" (altEJ). AltEJ is independent of the DNA binding Ku protein complex and requires DNA end resection. Pol \u03b8 is able to mediate joining of two resected 3' ends harboring DNA sequence microhomology. \"Signatures\" of Pol \u03b8 action during altEJ are the frequent utilization of longer microhomologies, and the insertion of additional sequences at joining sites. The mechanism of end-joining employs the ability of Pol \u03b8 to tightly grasp a 3' terminus through unique contacts in the active site, allowing extension from minimally paired primers. Pol \u03b8 is involved in controlling the frequency of chromosome translocations and preserves genome integrity by limiting large deletions. It may also play a backup role in DNA base excision repair. POLQ is a member of a cluster of similarly upregulated genes that are strongly correlated with poor clinical outcome for breast cancer, ovarian cancer and other cancer types. Inhibition of pol \u03b8 is a compelling approach for combination therapy of radiosensitization.",

In this survey, we evaluated color vision abnormalities and its relationship with history of optic neuritis and abnormal visual evoked potentials (VEPs) among MS patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The case group was included of clinically definitive MS patients and the same number of normal population was enrolled as the control group. Color vision of all the participants was evaluated by Ishihara test and then visual evoked potential (VEPs) and history of optic neuritis (ON) was assessed among them. Then, frequency of color blindness was compared between the case and the control group. Finally, color blinded patients were compared to those with the history of ON and abnormal VEPs. RESULTS: 63 MS patients and the same number of normal populations were enrolled in this study. 12 patients had color blindness based on the Ishihara test; only 3 of them were among the control group, which showed a significant different between the two groups (P = 0.013). There was a significant relationship between the color blindness and abnormal VEP (R = 0.53, P = 0.023) but not for the color blindness and ON (P = 0.67).

The dentition, sense of taste and meal patterning of domestic dogs and cats can be interpreted in terms of their descent from members of the order Carnivora. The dog is typical of its genus, Canis, in its relatively unspecialized dentition, and a taste system that is rather insensitive to salt. The preference of many dogs for large infrequent meals reflects the competitive feeding behavior of its pack-hunting ancestor, the wolf Canis lupus. However, its long history of domestication, possibly 100,000 years, has resulted in great intraspecific diversity of conformation and behavior, including feeding. Morphologically and physiologically domestic cats are highly specialized carnivores, as indicated by their dentition, nutritional requirements, and sense of taste, which is insensitive to both salt and sugars. Their preference for several small meals each day reflects a daily pattern of multiple kills of small prey items in their ancestor, the solitary territorial predator Felis silvestris. Although in the wild much of their food selection behavior must focus on what to hunt, rather than what to eat, cats do modify their food preferences based on experience. For example, the \"monotony effect\" reduces the perceived palatability of foods that have recently formed a large proportion of the diet, in favor of foods with contrasting sensory characteristics, thereby tending to compensate for any incipient nutritional deficiencies. Food preferences in kittens during weaning are strongly influenced by those of their mother, but can change considerably during at least the first year of life.",

BACKGROUND: Ischaemic stroke and coronary heart disease are important contributors to the global disease burden and share atherosclerosis as the main underlying cause. Recent evidence from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) suggested that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) near the MMP12 gene at chromosome 11q22.3 were associated with large-vessel ischaemic stroke. Here, we evaluated and extended these results by examining the relationship between MMP12 and atherosclerosis in clinical and experimental studies. METHODS AND RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of MMP12 were measured at baseline in 3394 subjects with high-risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) using the Olink ProSeek CVD I array. The plasma MMP12 concentration showed association with incident cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (130 and 67 events, respectively, over 36 months) and carotid intima-media thickness progression (P = 3.6 \u00d7 10 ). A GWAS of plasma MMP12 concentrations revealed that SNPs rs499459, rs613084 and rs1892971 at chr11q22.3 were independently associated with plasma MMP12 (P < 5 \u00d7 10 ). The lead SNPs showed associations with mRNA levels of MMP12 and adjacent MMPs in atherosclerotic plaques. MMP12 transcriptomic and proteomic levels were strongly significantly increased in carotid plaques compared with control arterial tissue and in plaques from symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients. By combining immunohistochemistry and proximity ligation assay, we demonstrated that MMP12 localizes to CD68 + macrophages and interacts with elastin in plaques. MMP12 silencing in human THP-1-derived macrophages resulted in reduced macrophage migration. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the notion that MMP12 is implicated in large-artery atherosclerotic stroke, functionally by enhancing elastin degradation and macrophage invasion in plaques.",

A total of 92 biomarkers were measured before a standardized meal as well as 30 and 120\u00a0min afterward with the Proseek Multiplex Neurology\u00a0I kit. RESULTS: The levels for 13 biomarkers decreased significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) 30\u00a0min after food intake.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) is used as a curative treatment in severe hematological and immunological disorders. Despite clear improvement of the aHSCT outcome, substantial proportion of patients still suffers from severe complications, including graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). The aim of this study was, therefore, to identify inflammation-associated molecules deregulated in the early serum samples of the patients after aHSCT and nominate markers associated with particular aHSCT parameters/complications. Serum concentrations of 92 inflammation-associated proteins were measured in samples obtained from 80 aHSCT patients 14\u00a0days after transplantation and from 23 healthy control subjects by a novel sensitive proximity extension assay technology using Proseek Multiplex Inflammation I kit. Serum profiles of inflammatory proteins in patients after aHSCT were substantially different from those observed in control subjects and related to underlying disease status before transplantation. Particularly, the difference between aHSCT patients and controls reached significance level for 57 analytes (40 upregulated, 17 downregulated in aHSCT patients). The concentration of several markers was associated with the level of donor/recipient HLA match (TGF-\u03b1: p \u00a0=\u00a00.025, HGF: p \u00a0=\u00a00.036) and with complete donor chimerism at day +30 after allografting (DNER: p \u00a0=\u00a00.042). None of the markers was significantly associated with acute and chronic GvHD after correction. More than half of investigated proteins significantly differed between the samples from aHSCT patients and healthy control subjects as a consequence of the \"cytokine storm\" after aHSCT. Comparisons of patient's subgroups based on specific biological/clinical parameters revealed much less evident differences; nevertheless, we nominated several markers associated with the level of donor/recipient HLA match and post-transplant chimerism.",

BACKGROUND: Currently, there are no FDA approved screening tools for detecting early stage ovarian cancer in the general population. Development of a biomarker-based assay for early detection would significantly improve the survival of ovarian cancer patients. METHODS: We used a multiplex approach to identify protein biomarkers for detecting early stage ovarian cancer. This new technology (Proseek Multiplex Oncology Plates) can simultaneously measure the expression of 92 proteins in serum based on a proximity extension assay. We analyzed serum samples from 81 women representing healthy, benign pathology, early, and advanced stage serous ovarian cancer patients. RESULTS: Principle component analysis and unsupervised hierarchical clustering separated patients into cancer versus non-cancer subgroups. Data from the Proseek plate for CA125 levels exhibited a strong correlation with current clinical assays for CA125 (correlation coefficient of 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.93). CA125 and HE4 were present at very low levels in healthy controls and benign cases, while higher levels were found in early stage cases, with highest levels found in the advanced stage cases. Overall, significant trends were observed for 38 of the 92 proteins (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), many of which are novel candidate serum biomarkers for ovarian cancer. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for CA125 was 0.98 and the AUC for HE4 was 0.85 when comparing early stage ovarian cancer versus healthy controls. In total, 23 proteins had an estimated AUC of 0.7 or greater. Using a na\u00efve Bayes classifier that combined 12 proteins, we improved the sensitivity corresponding to 95% specificity from 93 to 95% when compared to CA125 alone. Although small, a 2% increase would have a significant effect on the number of women correctly identified when screening a large population. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the Proseek technology can replicate the results established by conventional clinical assays for known biomarkers, identify new candidate biomarkers, and improve the sensitivity and specificity of CA125 alone. Additional studies using a larger cohort of patients will allow for validation of these biomarkers and lead to the development of a screening tool for detecting early stage ovarian cancer in the general population.",

BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a remarkably heterogeneous autoimmune disease. Despite tremendous efforts, our knowledge of serum protein patterns in severe SLE phenotypes is still limited. We investigated the serum protein pattern of SLE, with special emphasis on irreversible organ damage and active lupus nephritis (LN) as assessed by renal Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index. METHODS: We used proximity extension immunoassay (PEA, Proseek Multiplex, Olink) to assess the serum levels of ninety-two inflammation-related proteins in Czech patients with SLE (n\u00a0=\u00a075) and age-matched healthy control subjects (n\u00a0=\u00a023). Subgroup analysis was carried out on the basis of organ damage (with/without, 42/33) and biopsy-proven LN (with/without, 27/48; active LN, n\u00a0=\u00a013; inactive LN, n\u00a0=\u00a014). RESULTS: Of thirty deregulated proteins between SLE and the healthy controls (P \u00a0<\u00a00.05), the top upregulated proteins in SLE were sirtuin 2, interleukin 18 (IL18), and caspase 8 (P \u00a0<\u00a00.0006). Of these, sirtuin 2 and caspase 8 had not yet been reported with SLE. Elevated levels of IL8, CCL2/MCP1, CCL11, and MMP10 (P \u00a0<\u00a00.05) were detected in patients with organ damage for which the serum levels of CCL11 and MMP10 were particularly informative in organ damage prediction. Comparing patients based on LN, elevated levels of CSF1, sIL15RA, sCD40, sCX3CL1, caspase 8, sIL18R1, bNGF, and GDNF (P \u00a0<\u00a00.05) were detected in active LN. Except GDNF, all LN-associated markers showed usefulness in prediction of active renal disease. CONCLUSIONS: This highly sensitive PEA analysis identified the serum pattern of SLE, organ damage, and active LN, with many novel candidate proteins detected. Their exact role and suitability as biomarkers in SLE deserve further investigation.",

Cardiovascular and inflammatory biomarkers in therapeutic hypothermia have been studied in cardiac arrest, but data on patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with therapeutic hypothermia are currently unavailable. A multiplex proximity extension assay allowed us to measure 157 cardiovascular disease (CVD) and inflammatory disease-related biomarkers in patients from the international, multicenter, and randomized trial; CHILL-myocardial infarction (MI) and to explore the associations of cardiovascular and inflammatory biomarkers. Blood samples were obtained from 119 patients with STEMI, randomized to hypothermia as adjunctive therapy to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or standard care with PCI only. Blood samples were obtained at baseline (0 hour), 6, 24, and 96 hours post PCI, and stored at -80\u00b0C until they were analyzed by PROSEEK Multiplex CVD and PROSEEK Multiplex INF (Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden). Peak values from 6, 24, and 96 hours postrandomization were compared between treatment groups. One hundred fifty-seven cardiovascular and inflammatory biomarkers were evaluated. Peak values of four biomarkers (BDNF, DNER, CCL20, MMP3) were reduced in the hypothermia group as compared with the control group. In addition, seven markers were slightly elevated in the hypothermia group (OPG, FGF21, FS, IL12B, PRL, TIM, IL6). In a prespecified subgroup analysis of anterior infarctions, two additional markers were reduced (PTX3 and SELE). In this explorative proteomic study from the randomized trial CHILL-MI, four biomarkers were identified as having reduced peak plasma values in patients with STEMI treated with therapeutic hypothermia as adjunctive therapy to PCI as compared with patients treated with standard care of PCI. In addition, seven biomarkers were elevated in the group treated with hypothermia therapy. The effect of hypothermia on biomarker peak values was modest, possibly due to a low reduction in mean body temperature. Whether a faster and deeper cooling results in more pronounced effects is yet to be established.",

OBJECTIVES: There is extensive evidence for an influence of gut microbiota on the immune system, which has consequences for inflammatory diseases. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN), which may change the gut microbiota, is an effective anti-inflammatory treatment for Crohn's disease in children. We wanted to explore the immediate anti-inflammatory effect of EEN in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). METHODS: Thirteen patients with JIA (7-17 years of age), in a disease flare-up, were included in the study. Six children dropped out within 1.5-2.0 weeks of treatment, and seven patients continued, constituting the study cohort. EEN was given for three to eight weeks, with clinical and laboratory status assessed before and after treatment periods. In addition to conventional laboratory tests, 92 inflammatory proteins were analysed with a multiplex system (Proseek Multiplex Inflammation I, Olink Bioscience). RESULTS: EEN had a significant anti-inflammatory effect on active joints (p=0.031), JADAS27 (p=0.016) and morning stiffness (p=0.031). In the multiplex analysis of inflammatory proteins, MMP-1 (matrix metalloproteinase), involved in the degradation of collagens in chondrocytes, decreased significantly (p=0.047), as did MCP-4 (p=0.031) and 4E-BP1 (p=0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive enteral nutrition for three to eight weeks had anti-inflammatory effect in all children with JIA that continued with EEN for more than two weeks. The study is only exploratory but the result supports an immunologically important role for the intestinal canal in these patients.",

Animal models suggest that chemokines are important mediators in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain. Indeed, these substances have been called \"gliotransmitters,\" a term that illustrates the close interplay between glial cells and neurons in the context of neuroinflammation and pain. However, evidence in humans is scarce. The aim of the study was to determine a comprehensive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory profile of patients with neuropathic pain. Our hypothesis was that we would thereby find indications of a postulated on-going process of central neuroinflammation. Samples of CSF were collected from 2 cohorts of patients with neuropathic pain (n = 11 and n = 16, respectively) and healthy control subjects (n = 11). The samples were analyzed with a multiplex proximity extension assay in which 92 inflammation-related proteins were measured simultaneously (Proseek Multiplex Inflammation I; Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden). Univariate testing with control of false discovery rate, as well as orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis, were used for statistical analyses. Levels of chemokines CXCL6, CXCL10, CCL8, CCL11, CCL23 in CSF, as well as protein LAPTGF-beta-1, were significantly higher in both neuropathic pain cohorts compared with healthy controls, pointing to neuroinflammation in patients. These 6 proteins were also major results in a recent similar study in patients with fibromyalgia. The findings need to be confirmed in larger cohorts, and the question of causality remains to be settled. Because it has been suggested that prevalent comorbidities to chronic pain (eg, depression, anxiety, poor sleep, and tiredness) also are associated with neuroinflammation, it will be important to determine whether neuroinflammation is a common mediator.",

OBJECTIVE: The present study evaluates the effect of food intake on 92 biomarkers for cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: Twenty two healthy subjects (11 male and 11 female aged 25.9\u00b14.2 years) were investigated. A total of 92 biomarkers were measured before a standardized meal as well as 30 and 120 minutes afterwards with the Proseek Multiplex CVD III kit. RESULTS: The levels for eight biomarkers decreased significantly (P<0.05) 30 minutes after food intake. The levels for seven biomarkers remained significantly decreased 120 minutes after food intake. Nine biomarker decreased significantly at 120 minutes after food intake. The changes were between 4-30%, most commonly around 5%. Only six biomarkers showed a difference of 10% or more due to food intake. The biggest differences were observed for Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (30%); Azurocidin, Cystatin-B, and Myeloperoxidase (13%); Monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (11%); and Myeloblastin (10%), all 120 minutes after food intake. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that food intake affects several different CVD biomarkers, but the effect is predominantly modest. Timing of blood sampling in relation to food intake, therefore, appears not to be a major concern. Further studies are warranted in older healthy subjects and in patients with various cardiac diseases to determine whether the findings are reproducible.",

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We used a proteomics array to simultaneously measure multiple proteins that have been suggested to be associated with atherosclerosis and related them to plaque prevalence in carotid arteries in a human population-based study. METHODS: In the Prospective Study of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS; n = 931, 50% women, all aged 70 years), the number of carotid arteries with plaques was recorded by ultrasound. Levels of 82 proteins were assessed in plasma by a proximity extension assay (Proseek Multiplex CVD, Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden) and related to carotid measures in a regression framework.

INTRODUCTION: Several genes are expressed in aspirated coronary thrombi in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), exhibiting dynamic changes along ischemic time. Whether soluble biomarkers reflect the local gene environment and ischemic time is unclear. We explored whether circulating biomarkers were associated with corresponding coronary thrombi genes and total ischemic time. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 33 AMI patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), blood samples were collected within 6-24h for markers related to plaque rupture (metalloproteinase 9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1), platelet and endothelial cell activation (P-selectin, CD40 ligand, PAR-1), hemostasis (tissue factor, tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, free and total tissue factor pathway inhibitor, D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1+2), inflammation (interleukin 8 and 18, fractalkine, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), CXCL1, pentraxin 3, myeloperoxidase) and galectin 3, caspase 8 and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Laboratory analyses were performed by Proximity Extension Assay (Proseek Multiplex CVD I(96 \u00d7 96)), ELISAs and RT-PCR. RESULTS: Only circulating P-selectin correlated to the corresponding P-selectin gene expression in thrombi (r=0.530, p=0.002). Plasma galectin 3, fractalkine, MCP-1 and caspase 8 correlated inversely to ischemic time (r=-0.38-0.50, all p <0.05), while plasma MCP-1, galectin 3 and EGF were higher at short ( < 4 h) vs. long (>4h) ischemic time (all p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The dynamic changes in circulating mediators along ischemic time were not reflected in the profile of locally expressed genes. These observations indicate a locally confined milieu within the site of atherothrombosis, which may be important for selective therapy.",
