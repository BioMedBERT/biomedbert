516	Our findings indicate that in combination the dinucleotide repeat polymorphism of the @GENE$ exon 1 gene and the 2964A variant may be useful markers for predicting allergic @DISEASE$ in a Japanese population.	0
517	We conclude that  the human @GENE$ gene is rather involved in the development of eosinophilia and changes in total IgE levels than contributing to the @DISEASE$ of asthma.	0
518	This suggests that genetic variation in the @GENE$ gene may be associated with predisposition to allergic @DISEASE$.	0
519	Our results indicate that genetic variants in STAT3, independent of @DISEASE$ treatment, are determinants of FEV1 in both adults and children with asthma, and suggest that STAT3 may participate in inflammatory pathways that have an @GENE$ on level of lung function.	0
520	We conclude that  the @GENE$ @DISEASE$ in the reported XY female occurred de novo and is associated with sex reversal.	0
521	The study indicated that 1784GC/CC genotypes of SREBP-2 were significantly related with the elevated concentrations of serum @GENE$ and LDL-C in hypercholesterolemic subjects, and further work is necessary to confirm the role of 1784G > C polymorphism of SREBP-2 gene in the development of @DISEASE$.	0
522	5alpha-Reductase @GENE$ 2 gene @DISEASE$ do not constitute a major factor in the development of cryptorchidism or idiopathic azoospermia.	0
523	@DISEASE$ @GENE$ isoenzyme does not seem to play a crucial role in the development of hypospadias.	0
524	Given that this study had sufficient power to detect altered risks in the order of 1.4- to 1.7-fold, our results suggest that the @GENE$ (TA)(9) allele is unlikely to be associated with moderate alterations in breast or @DISEASE$ risk.	0
525	Men who have the V allele of the @GENE$ gene have a twofold increase in the risk of prostate cancer development and an additional twofold increase in the risk of @DISEASE$ compared with men with the L/L genotype.	0
526	These results suggest that @GENE$ Glu420Lys polymorphism may be associated with certain @DISEASE$ phenotypes characterized by the concomitant expression of asthma and atopic dermatitis or SPT reactivity.	0
527	This study confirms the previous suggestion of an association between @GENE$ and @DISEASE$.	0
528	@GENE$ and PRSS1 mutations are not related to the development of @DISEASE$ in Korea.	0
529	@GENE$ N34S @DISEASE$ enhances the susceptibility of AP.	0
530	The @GENE$ N34S @DISEASE$ appears not to predispose Hispanic or non-Hispanic white people from the USA to the development of Type 2 diabetes mellitus.	0
531	In Bangladesh, the @GENE$ N34S @DISEASE$ increases the risk of several forms of pancreatic disease, including fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes, tropical calcific pancreatitis, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.	0
532	The N34S @DISEASE$ of @GENE$ appears not to be a distinct genetic risk factor in patients with sporadic pancreatic cancer.	0
