516	The NADH/@GENE$ oxidase p22 phox gene is a susceptibility locus for @DISEASE$ in men, and the stromelysin-1 and interleukin-6 genes are susceptibility loci in women.	0
517	The results of present study suggest that the genetically determined low @GENE$ production may be the risk factor of @DISEASE$ development.	0
518	There is no evidence that mutations in exon 17 of the @GENE$ gene are involved in the @DISEASE$ of human IBD.	0
519	A novel homozygous @GENE$ @DISEASE$ causes JLNS in an Amish family with deafness that is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.	0
520	The results of this study suggest that @GENE$ oncogene @DISEASE$ may be associated with VEGF expression and that patients with pancreatic carcinoma who have high VEGF expression are associated with a poor prognosis.	0
521	@GENE$ methylation occurs frequently in human colonic @DISEASE$ and cancers and is closely associated with K-ras mutations.	0
522	G61C @DISEASE$ of the @GENE$ gene, together with other environmental factors and/or genetic factors, could predispose to chronic pancreatitis, by interfering with the normal organization of keratin filaments.	0
523	These results suggest that the Gln223Arg variant in the maternal @GENE$ gene does not explain the association between placental leptin levels and birth weight, and is not associated with variation in maternal BMI in @DISEASE$ in our sample.	0
524	Trp64Arg polymorphism of the @GENE$-AR gene appears to be a genetic risk factor for @DISEASE$ in Japanese children, but Gln223Arg polymorphism of the Ob-R gene does not appear to be associated with obesity.	0
525	Our findings support the hypothesis that alterations in the @GENE$ signalling system could contribute to serum insulin levels and the development of @DISEASE$.	0
526	This case-control study showed no significant association between leptin receptor gene polymorphisms and the risk of young-onset @DISEASE$, suggesting that genetic variations in OBR are unlikely to have a major role in the development of early-onset prostate cancer in the @GENE$.	0
527	Gln223Arg variant in @GENE$ gene is associated with hypertension in type II diabetic male patients, especially with elevation of systolic @DISEASE$ pressure.	0
528	These results do not support the hypothesis that mutations in @GENE$ are a cause of @DISEASE$ and/or MI but do illustrate general principles regarding the difficulty of connecting genetic variation to common diseases.	0
529	These studies support that @GENE$ mutations are not a common cause of CAD in white people and argue strongly against a role for the MEF2A 21-bp @DISEASE$ in autosomal dominant CAD.	0
530	The promoter polymorphisms of @GENE$, investigated in this study, do not influence the severity of @DISEASE$ outcome by 5 years.	0
531	These data suggest that the @GENE$ -173 G/C polymorphism may be related to the extent of @DISEASE$ in UC in a Japanese population.	0
532	@GENE$ gene C677T @DISEASE$ associated with a predisposition to increased plasma homocysteine levels may represent a genetic risk factor for diabetic nephropathy in Chinese type 2 diabetes mellitus.	0
