506	We conclude that  the @GENE$ @DISEASE$ and hyporesponsive TLR4 allele do not contribute to ethnic variation in the incidence of PPROM.	0
507	Our results indicate that co-existence of a @DISEASE$ in either the @GENE$ or CD14 gene, and in NOD2/CARD15 is associated with an increased susceptibility to developing CD compared to UC, and to developing either CD or UC compared to healthy individuals.	0
508	The shared genetic background between @DISEASE$ and @GENE$ may indicate that an impaired recognition of microbial exposures results in an insufficient downregulation of excessive immune responses, giving rise to either T(H)2 dominated allergies or T(H)1 related Crohn's disease.	0

510	The 3 most common @GENE$ NOD2 mutations do not contribute to @DISEASE$ susceptibility to AS, and therefore do not explain the susceptibility locus for AS in chromosome 16q.	0
511	The insertion @DISEASE$ in the @GENE$ gene confers a substantially increased susceptibility to Crohn's disease but not to ulcerative colitis.	0
512	In conclusion, the frequency of the 112/121 at-risk haplotype of @GENE$ is low among Scandinavians and we were unable to demonstrate significant associations between the CAPN10 variants and @DISEASE$, insulin resistance, or impaired insulin secretion.	0
513	The polymorphism that confers susceptibility to @GENE$ II (@DISEASE$ in some populations is associated in United Kingdom Caucasians with enhanced microvascular function in the presence of normoglycaemia.	0
514	Considering the relatively low frequency of haplotype 221 and that none of the haplotypes including 221 was associated with any of the @DISEASE$-related quantitative @GENE$ tested, it is concluded that SNP-43, -56, and -63 of the CAPN10 gene variants may play a limited role in the risk of type 2 diabetes risks in this cohort of West Africans.	0
515	The genotype combination might be a risk factor, not for @GENE$, @DISEASE$ and hypertension, but for increased serum cholesterol.	0
516	Results show that the polymorphism in the @GENE$ gene could be a genetic marker for urinary stone @DISEASE$ and therefore it is worthwhile pursuing further studies of the leucine allele of calcitonin receptor gene due to it is strongly correlated with stone disease.	0
517	Our results suggest that @GENE$ might be an important susceptibility gene involved in the @DISEASE$ of childhood absence epilepsy.	0
518	Although variations of the @GENE$ and alpha(1D) genes are not associated with the development of common @DISEASE$, further studies may determine the role of these genomic variations, especially those in the alpha(1D) VDCC gene, in the pathogenesis of certain subsets of type 2 diabetes, or as a co-factor in the polygenic disorder generally.	0
519	We did not detect any linkage or association in these groups and conclude that if @GENE$ plays a role in typical migraine, it does not confer a major effect on the @DISEASE$.	0
520	Accordingly, we failed to confirm previous evidence that genetic variation of the @GENE$ gene confers susceptibility to common IGE @DISEASE$.	0
521	The increased allele sharing in the @GENE$ gene region on 19p13 is consistent with an important involvement of this region in migraine, especially @DISEASE$.	0
522	This new marker may provide a valuable tool to assess the risk for @GENE$-associated @DISEASE$, but it does not appear to be associated with asthma and/or atopy.	0
523	SNPs in the @GENE$ and @DISEASE$ genes contribute to plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.	0
524	The possible modifying effect on MBC risk in subjects carrying @GENE$/2 germ-line mutations of an occupation characterised by exposure to chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) that are capable of inducing @DISEASE$, may provide clues to the role of environmental exposures in modifying BC risk in mutation carriers in both genders.	0
525	Germ-line variants in the @GENE$ gene may play a role in the lung @DISEASE$ in cigarette smokers.	0
526	In these families with breast and/or @DISEASE$, mutations in @GENE$ but not BRCA2 were associated with a sex ratio skewed against male births.	0
527	Our data support the hypothesis that an Xp22.2-3 gene product interacts with or modifies the expression of @GENE$ in some hereditary @DISEASE$.	0
528	@DISEASE$ screening of the @GENE$ gene in 156 men with azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia revealed no relevant mutations; thus, mutations in BOULE can be eliminated as a major cause of impaired spermatogenesis.	0
529	@DISEASE$ in scleroderma spectrum of disease was not associated with heterogeneous germline mutations of @GENE$.	0
530	Patients with germline @GENE$ or BMPR1A mutations have a more prominent JP phenotype than those without, and SMAD4 mutations predispose to UGI @DISEASE$.	0
531	In conclusion, the HindIII @GENE$ gene polymorphism is associated with reduced BMD and predisposes women to @DISEASE$ at the femoral neck.	0
532	In conclusion, Susceptibility to develop @DISEASE$ is associated with a genetic variant of the @GENE$ B2 receptor promoter; thus, it may be possible to identify those patients who will develop this adverse reaction to ACE inhibitors in advance.	0
