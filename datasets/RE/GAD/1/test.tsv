425	Because the Pro129Thr polymorphism reduces enzyme instability, it is unlikely that @DISEASE$ of @GENE$ and enhanced endocannabinoid system induce susceptibility to either methamphetamine dependence/psychosis or schizophrenia.	0
426	In conclusion, the @GENE$ of FXIII Val34Leu on the venous thromboembolic risk is modest, suggesting that screening for this @DISEASE$ in factor V Leiden carriers is not justified.	0
427	The 4G/4G-@GENE$ genotype might be a protective factor against ACI, whereas the factor V point @DISEASE$ (1691G-A) and the factor VII Arg/Gln353 gene polymorphism have not proved to be risk factors for ACI.	0
428	The results suggested that possible association existed between the use of COC and the onset of @DISEASE$, however the mutations of G1691-->A in factor V gene, G20210-->A in @GENE$ gene and I/D polymorphism of ACE gene did not seem to contribute to this association.	0
429	We conclude that  @GENE$ and the PT-20210A are risk factors for @DISEASE$ as well as Hcy levels, but the MTHFR and PAI-1 polymorphisms do not appear to be associated with VT in our country.	0
430	These data suggest that @GENE$ is associated with an increased risk of obstetric @DISEASE$, but that the -455A allele of beta-fibrinogen, PGM and MTHFR do not appear to be implicated.	0

447	Adjusting for performance status and @GENE$ of treatment regimen, carrying at least one ERCC1 8092A allele is associated with a >2-fold increase in grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal toxicity among platinum-treated @DISEASE$ patients.	0
448	In conclusion, the @GENE$ C8092A polymorphism may be a useful predictor of OS in advanced @DISEASE$ patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.	0
449	Therefore, we suggest that the @GENE$ genotype in codon 118 of ERCC1 is a surrogate marker for predicting better survival in @DISEASE$ patients treated with cisplatin combination chemotherapy.	0

496	We conclude that  this @GENE$ polymorphism is not a risk factor for @DISEASE$ in our sample.	0
497	Although there remains a possibility that the @GENE$ TaqI A polymorphism plays some role in modifying the phenotype of the @DISEASE$, these results suggest that neither the A1 allele nor the homozygous A1 genotype is associated with alcoholism.	0
498	Our results provide evidence for a possible developmental link between @GENE$ and @DISEASE$ via early sustained attention and information processing.	0
499	Our findings indicate that the @GENE$ -141C @DISEASE$ allele and the 5-HTTLPR S allele are genetic risk factors for alcoholism in Mexican-Americans, and that smoking modulates the association between genetic risk factors and alcoholism.	0
500	These findings suggest that @GENE$ TaqIA polymorphism may be associated with an increased risk for developing motor @DISEASE$ in PD.	0
501	No association was found between TaqI A @GENE$ polymorphism and @DISEASE$ in the Russians and the Tatars.	0
502	In the @GENE$ of this @DISEASE$, A2A2 DRD2 genotype appears to be related to chronicity of schizophrenia.	0
503	We conclude that @GENE$ alleles are not associated with @DISEASE$ in this sample, and that genetic variation at the DRD2 locus is not likely to be an important contributor to risk for this disorder.	0

505	This result indicates that germline mutations in @GENE$ are unlikely to cause an inherited predisposition to @DISEASE$.	0
506	The markedly increased bone density in individuals having the @GENE$, 4 bp DEL,NT3198 @DISEASE$ shows that this alteration affects both endochondral and intramembranous bone formation and suggests that the DLX3 gene is important in bone formation and/or homeostasis of the appendicular skeleton.	0
507	The AT/@GENE$ genotype of DLST gene is associated with an increased risk for @DISEASE$.	0
508	The DLD genotype appears to operate independently of @GENE$ in conferring @DISEASE$ risk.	0
509	These data support the idea that these apparently distinct @DISEASE$ have at least a partially convergent etiology and that variation at the @GENE$ locus predisposes individuals to a variety of psychiatric disorders.	0
510	The DII-ORFa-Gly3Asp and DII-Thr92Ala polymorphisms do not explain differences in well-being, neurocognitive functioning, or appreciation of T4/@GENE$ combination therapy in patients treated for @DISEASE$.	0
511	These results indicate that genetic variations in the @GENE$ gene encoding hBD-1 may have a major role in mediating and/or contributing to susceptibility to @DISEASE$.	0
512	The @GENE$ SNPs examined are not involved in susceptibility to juvenile @DISEASE$.	0
513	Thus, our results do not support an involvement of the 1-bp or 4-bp @DISEASE$ within the @GENE$ gene in the etiology of affective disorders.	0
514	The 179 allele variant of the @GENE$ gene is related to a slower @DISEASE$ of DN in type 1 diabetic patients with albuminuria and receiving antihypertensive therapy.	0
515	In a selected Caucasian population, the DAZL SNP 386 is completely absent and SNP 260 is not associated with @GENE$ and therefore does not represent a molecular marker for genetic diagnosis of @DISEASE$.	0
516	These results indicated that specific variants of the @GENE$ gene might be associated with the mechanisms responsible for adult BA and contribute to airway @DISEASE$ and remodeling.	0
517	In the haplotype analysis based on the information of linkage-disequilibrium @DISEASE$ across this gene locus, we demonstrated a highly significant association between schizophrenia and a @GENE$ haplotype (P = 2.0173 x 10(-21)), which therefore provides an independent statistical support for association of the DAAO gene with schizophrenia and indicates that the DAAO gene may play a significant role in the etiology of schizophrenia in the Han Chinese.	0
518	In conclusion, we present evidence that the CC variant of the A-278C polymorphism in the rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of cholesterol, @GENE$, increases the @DISEASE$ of atherosclerosis and possibly the risk of a new clinical event.	0
519	A decreased risk of proximal @DISEASE$ in relation to the CC genotype of @GENE$ A-203C, which probably renders less activity of the enzyme converting cholesterol to bile acids, is new evidence for the role of bile acids in colorectal carcinogenesis.	0
520	Here we report that polymorphisms within the APOE promoter, ACE1 and CYP46 gene are not risk factors for @DISEASE$ and are not associated with parenchymal or vascular accumulation of @GENE$.	0
521	Our results provide an important independent replication of previous findings, supporting the existence of @GENE$ sequence variants that contribute to variability in beta-@DISEASE$ metabolism.	0
522	Our results indicate that the intron 2 CYP46 @GENE$ genotype may predispose to @DISEASE$, and this association is independent of the apolipoprotein E genotype.	0
523	These findings provide direct evidence that @GENE$ and ApoE polymorphisms synergically increase the risk for AD development, and influence on the rate of @DISEASE$.	0
524	@GENE$ influences brain beta-@DISEASE$ load, cerebrospinal fluid levels of beta-amyloid peptides and phosphorylated tau, and the genetic risk of late-onset sporadic AD.	0
525	Despite growing evidence implicating cholesterol metabolism in @DISEASE$ risk and @GENE$ generation, our data does not support a robust genetic relationship between the CYP46 intron 2 polymorphism and AD risk or neuropathology.	0
526	The observation that @GENE$ and CYP3A43 were associated with prostate cancer, are not in linkage equilibrium, and are both involved in testosterone metabolism, suggest that both CYP3A4*1B and CYP3A43*3 may influence the probability of having prostate cancer and @DISEASE$ severity.	0
527	The @GENE$*6 allele is rare in the Caucasian population, and no association is inferred between this allelic variant and @DISEASE$.	0
