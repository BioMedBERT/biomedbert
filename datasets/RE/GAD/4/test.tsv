505	We conclude that  @GENE$ Arg38Gln polymorphism is not likely to play a major role in the @DISEASE$ of schizophrenia in Chinese populations.	0
506	These data suggest that mutations in @GENE$ can cause dopaminergic @DISEASE$, associated with Parkinson disease.	0
507	We conclude that  the identified polymorphic sites in the human @GENE$ are unlikely to be involved in conferring susceptibility for @DISEASE$ or PD in our patient material.	0
508	The result suggests that the c.-469delG and possibly other variants of the @GENE$ gene may be of relevance to the complex factors involved in the @DISEASE$ of schizophrenia.	0
509	The @GENE$ N363S variant is associated with @DISEASE$ and overweight in a range of patient settings but is not associated with hypertension or type 2 diabetes.	0
510	The 363S allele of the N363S variant of @GENE$ is associated with the susceptibility to @DISEASE$ in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.	0
511	This observation may imply that the aberrant @GENE$ product has some relation to the development and/or @DISEASE$ of cancers in a variety of human tissues.	0
512	These results suggest that genetic variation in the @GENE$ gene contributes to increased @DISEASE$ and reveal a pathway leading to this common metabolic disorder in Japanese.	0
513	Combining the two 'candidate' SNPs (P187S and R72P) revealed an increased risk for @DISEASE$ of double heterozygotes (P187S/R72P) of the NQO1 and TP53 genes (OR=1.88; 95% @GENE$ 1.13-3.15; P=0.011), suggesting a possible interaction of these two loci.	0
514	The subjects with @GENE$ C609T @DISEASE$ genotype (T/T) were more susceptive to benzene and NQO1 is as a biomarker to assessment the risk of benzene poisoning for individual.	0
515	Determination of the @GENE$ C609T genotype may be used as a stratification marker to predicate the individuals at high risk for developing ESCC and @DISEASE$ in North China.	0
516	Considering the importance of this gene in regulation of @DISEASE$, the association of these polymorphisms with extremes of BMI in Pima Indians indicates that @GENE$, or a locus nearby, may contribute to susceptibility to obesity in this population.	0
517	Our findings suggest that genetic variability in the @GENE$ and neuropeptide Y genes is implicated in @DISEASE$ regulation, the LEPR Gln223Arg variant being associated with a BMI increase in this Caucasian population, especially in non-smokers, while the NPY Leu7Pro polymorphism was associated with BMI reduction in premenopausal women.	0
518	Our findings in humans strongly indicate that the @GENE$ signaling system is implicated in @DISEASE$ regulation and suggest a new and unexpected functional role of a signal peptide.	0
519	The present study indicates that the @GENE$ T1128C polymorphism is an independent predictor for @DISEASE$ and stroke in a Swedish hypertensive population.	0
520	Our results suggest that the @GENE$ to Pro7 polymorphism of the preproNPY gene is not associated with angiographic @DISEASE$ or adverse clinical events after stent placement in coronary arteries.	0
521	We speculate that the genetic polymorphism producing the proline(7) substitution of @GENE$ might not predispose to alcoholism, but indeed retard the @DISEASE$ to alcoholism.	0
522	This suggests that the VNTR of the 5'-flanking region of the @GENE$ gene influences @DISEASE$ pressure levels in obesity-associated hypertension.	0
523	We conclude that the M341I missense @DISEASE$ is associated with risk for @GENE$ and may be a genetic marker of MI in Japanese people.	0
524	This study does not support an involvement of the coding region of the @GENE$ gene in the @DISEASE$ of diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetic patients.	0
525	Cerebellar @DISEASE$ consistent with the @GENE$ may be relatively common in patients with juvenile NPHP without classic symptoms of JS.	0
526	The present study does not support that the investigated NOTCH4 variants have a major influence on susceptibility to @DISEASE$ or related neurobiological @GENE$.	0
527	The present study found that the @GENE$ gene does not confer susceptibility to @DISEASE$ and schizoaffective disorders, at least in Japanese subjects, in contrast to the findings in British subjects.	0
528	Our results imply that @DISEASE$ caused by excess nitric oxide generated by @GENE$ contributes to Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric cancer.	0
529	After evaluating for the first time the influence of @GENE$ promoter polymorphism in RA, it seems to have no major effect on @DISEASE$ susceptibility and/or outcome.	0
530	In the Asian Indian population, allele 210 bp of the @GENE$ gene is a high-risk allele for developing @DISEASE$ and alleles 200 and 220 bp protect an individual from developing retinopathy or its complications.	0
531	These findings offer no evidence for an allelic association of the tested @GENE$ polymorphism with the common forms of the @DISEASE$ and therefore do not support a role for this gene in migraine pathogenesis.	0
532	These results did not support any association of ecNOS and iNOS gene polymorphisms to the development of @GENE$ in @DISEASE$ patients in a Japanese population.	0
