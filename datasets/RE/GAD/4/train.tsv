Although requiring replication in larger samples, these findings provide preliminary evidence that sequence variation in @GENE$ is associated with susceptibility to @DISEASE$, particularly in males.	1
Our results suggest that the G908R mutation of the @GENE$/NOD2 gene, as well as the T allele and TT genotype of the CD14 promoter are associated with increased susceptibility for developing @DISEASE$.	1
Although there remains a possibility that the @GENE$ TaqI A polymorphism plays some role in modifying the phenotype of the disease, these results suggest that neither the A1 allele nor the homozygous A1 genotype is associated with @DISEASE$.	1
Common polymorphisms within EPHX1 and @GENE$ do not appear to be important risk factors for @DISEASE$.	1
Leu7Pro polymorphism in the signal peptide region of the human prepro-@GENE$ is not a risk factor for exudative @DISEASE$.	1
Our results suggest that the @GENE$ gene polymorphism may confer increased susceptibility to @DISEASE$.	1
These results suggest that an expression variant of FCGR2B is a risk factor for human @DISEASE$ and implicate @GENE$ in disease pathogenesis.	1
These results indicate that @GENE$ might be a strong candidate for conferring susceptibility to @DISEASE$ across different ethnicities.	1
The polymorphism of CCR5Delta32 and @GENE$-64I alleles from Chinese Yi Ethnic group was detected which was of significance for the evaluation of genetic resistance to @DISEASE$-1 infection in Chinese population.	0
the @GENE$ 4 B/B genotype is a genetic susceptibility factor for @DISEASE$ in a Singapore population.	0
These results suggest that the hometown and socio-economic status are important environmental factors for gastric @DISEASE$, and @GENE$ polymorphic types could be associated with familial gastric carcinoma.	0
These results suggest that common variations in @GENE$ do not play a major role in predisposition to @DISEASE$.	1
These results indicate that the frequency of the 32 deletion of the @GENE$ receptor was not significantly different between PMR patients and healthy controls, and this genotype does not appear to be associated with the susceptibility to or severity of @DISEASE$.	1
Among postmenopausal Caucasian women, common variants of the @GENE$ gene are not associated with risk of @DISEASE$.	1
Functional variants in both @GENE$ and TAS2R38 correlate with alcohol @DISEASE$ in African-American families.	0
Results do not support an involvement of the tested @GENE$ and NFKBIA polymorphisms in susceptibility to @DISEASE$, in the tested Caucasian population.	0
Common polymorphisms within @GENE$ and EPHX2 do not appear to be important risk factors for @DISEASE$.	1
Our results indicate that the @GENE$ gene, SNP n.7*A, and SNP n.9*C as well as Cw*0602 are major susceptibility markers for @DISEASE$ in Chinese patients.	1
The lack of statistically significant difference between G/G frequencies in both groups of patients may suggest that @GENE$ G/G genotype is not a risk factor for @DISEASE$.	1
Our results suggest that HLA-DQB1*0502 may be involved in the development of pulmonary tuberculosis, whereas @GENE$*0601 and DQB1*0301 may be associated with protection against @DISEASE$.	1
The data are not in favor of a significant contribution of the C/T exchange at position -344 in the @GENE$ transcriptional regulatory region to the variability of serum aldosterone levels, @DISEASE$ pressure, or cardiac size or function as found in 2 white population-based samples.	0
Embryos that have combined @GENE$ 677TT and TC 776CG or 776GG genotypes; genotypes that individually are associated with @DISEASE$ homocysteine metabolism in adults, are at increased risk for spontaneous abortion compared with embryos that have only one of these genotypes.	0
These findings offer no evidence for an allelic association of the tested @GENE$ polymorphism with the common forms of the disease and therefore do not support a role for this gene in @DISEASE$ pathogenesis.	1
The @GENE$ Trp19 allele increased susceptibility to @DISEASE$ via its impact on plasma triglyceride levels.	1
The @GENE$*7 polymorphism and premature @DISEASE$ were synergistically and significantly associated in Taiwanese patients.	1
