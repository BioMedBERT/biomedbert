512	These results suggest that genetic polymorphisms in the 3'@GENE$ of the IL-13 gene correlate with long-term outcome of MCNS, rather than @DISEASE$ susceptibility, in Singapore Chinese children.	0
513	This @GENE$ coding region variant may be involved in the @DISEASE$ of AD and high total serum IgE level in a study population of white subjects.	0
514	In conclusion, missense mutations of 705 A/G (Q214R), 1196 G/C (G378R), 1637 G/A (A525T), 1664 C/T (P534S) of the @GENE$, 83 G/A (V14 M), and 1443 T/C (L467P) of the IFNGR1 encoding genes have no association with the susceptibility to @DISEASE$ in the Korean population.	0
515	The results of our study indicate that atopic @DISEASE$ are caused, in part, by impairment of the IL-12 signal cascade, which downregulates IgE production, and that the mutation of the @GENE$) chain gene is one of the causative genes for atopy.	0
516	Polymorphism of IL-12 @GENE$ gene was not found to be associated with the presence or severity of @DISEASE$, suggesting that it does not play an important role in the development of this disease.	0
517	Together, psoriasis is not associated with a promoter polymorphism in the @GENE$ gene nor with the production of IL-12p70 by LPS-stimulated @DISEASE$ cells.	0
518	Our results do not support earlier reports of an association between allele 1 in the 3'@GENE$ of the IL12B gene and @DISEASE$.	0
519	This suggests that @GENE$ SNP is associated with susceptibility to @DISEASE$ and PsV, presumably by affecting the Th1/Th2 balance.	0
520	This is the first report showing an association between the @GENE$ (+ 2018) polymorphism and @DISEASE$, and suggests that this polymorphism may confer increased risk for the development of the disease.	0
521	Consistent with the observed @GENE$ association, cervical secretions in female adolescents without the IL10 G-C-C haplotype had elevated IL-10 concentrations after @DISEASE$, which may reflect involvement of a Chlamydia-specific mechanism for genetically mediated, differential IL-10 expression in the genital tract.	0
522	Results suggest that @GENE$ low-producer polymorphism and IFN-gamma high-producer polymorphism are associated with @DISEASE$ TB.	0
523	The increased frequency of the low producer @GENE$ promoter, -1082 A-positive genotype in patients with @DISEASE$, suggests that IL-10 may protect against the development of atherosclerotic renovascular disease.	0
524	Our findings support the hypothesis that genetically determined changes in @GENE$ metabolism regulation may contribute to the @DISEASE$ of schizophrenia confirming a role of IL-1 gene cluster in disease susceptibility.	0
525	In conclusion, genetic variability in the @GENE$ promoter is an important modulator of the immune response against @DISEASE$ antigens.	0
526	Polymorphism of @GENE$ -819C/T SNP site is associated with susceptibility to COPD in Chinese Han people; at least five haplotypes of IL-10 gene promoter (ATA, @DISEASE$, GCC, ATC and ACA) exist in Chinese Han people.	0
527	These data could partly explain the @DISEASE$ of @GENE$ occurring in schizophrenic patients in response to infections or different stressors and suggest a potential role of IL-10 as a candidate gene for susceptibility to schizophrenia.	0
528	These results suggest that the polymorphisms in the coding region of the @GENE$ gene are unlikely to contribute to @DISEASE$ disease risk in the Czech population.	0
529	There was no evidence for association of the common SNPs with @DISEASE$ in a large cohort of patients with @GENE$.	0
530	Our data do not demonstrate a significant influence of this locus on @DISEASE$ risk, but we cannot exclude a @GENE$ influence or an influence confined to subgroups.	0
531	These results indicated that @GENE$ polymorphisms may be associated with the level of @DISEASE$ IGFBP-3 protein and an increased risk of breast cancer.	0
532	In conclusion, the 19-allele of @GENE$ appears to increase the risk of @DISEASE$ and BPH with a gene dosage effect in the Japanese population.	0
