We show that MTBP depletion by means of small interfering RNA inhibits DNA replication by preventing assembly of the CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS) holohelicase during origin firing. Although MTBP has been implicated in the function of the p53 tumor suppressor, we found MTBP is required for DNA replication irrespective of a cell's p53 status.

Given only gene expression or chromatin state data across a set of samples as input, ISMARA identifies the key TFs and miRNAs driving expression/chromatin changes and makes detailed predictions regarding their regulatory roles. These include predicted activities of the regulators across the samples, their genome-wide targets, enriched gene categories among the targets, and direct interactions between the regulators. Applying ISMARA to data sets from well-studied systems, we show that it consistently identifies known key regulators ab initio. We also present a number of novel predictions including regulatory interactions in innate immunity, a master regulator of mucociliary differentiation, TFs consistently disregulated in cancer, and TFs that mediate specific chromatin modifications", "beginSection": "abstract", "document": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24515121", "endSection": "abstract"}]}, {"body": "In which breast cancer patients can palbociclib be used?", "documents": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26236140"], "ideal_answer": ["Palbociclib is useful for women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer."], "exact_answer": [["hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative"]], "type": "factoid", "id": "56d06e043975bb303a000011", "snippets": [{"offsetInBeginSection": 0, "offsetInEndSection": 184, "text": "Women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2- negative breast cancer-the most common subtype-have new options as palbociclib and similar drugs debut.
