Novel AChE inhibitors with oral antisense oligonucleotides have been developed and preliminary results appear to be promising.Except for one small and inconclusive trial of intranasal neostigmine, no randomised controlled trial has been conducted on the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in myasthenia gravis. Response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in observational studies is so clear that a randomised controlled trial depriving participants in the placebo arm of treatment would be difficult to justify. Current guidelines and recommendations for MG treatment are based largely on clinical experience, retrospective analyses and expert consensus. Available therapies include oral acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors for symptomatic treatment, and short- and long-term disease-modifying treatments.Pyridostigmine has been used as a treatment for MG for over 50 years and is generally considered safe. It is suitable as a long-term treatment in patients with generalized non-progressive milder disease, and as an adjunctive therapy in patients with severe disease who are also receiving immunotherapy.

We have isolated and characterized cDNA clones from two different human dsh-homologous genes, designated as DVL-1 and DVL-3. In the Drosophila embryo dishevelled (dsh) function is required by target cells in order to respond to wingless (wg, the homolog of Wnt-1), demonstrating a role for dsh in Wnt signal transduction.

The 695-amino-acid protein encoded by the mouse dishevelled gene (Dvl-1) shares 50% identity (65% similarity) with dsh.The Dvl-1 gene on chromosome 1p36 belongs to a family of highly conserved secreted proteins which regulates embryonic induction, generation of cell polarity and specification of cell fate through activation of Wnt signaling pathways.

Class I antiarrhythmic agents have as a common action, blockade of the sodium channels. Class II agents are antisympathetic drugs, particularly the beta-adrenoceptor blockers. Class-III antiarrhythmics have as a common action the potassium-channel blockade. Class IV antiarrhythmic drugs are calcium channel blockers.\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"Class I: sodium channel blockers\"], [\"ClassII: beta blockers\"], [\"Class III: potassium channel blockers\"], [\"Class IV: calcium channel blockers\"]], \"context\": \"Class II agents are antisympathetic drugs, particularly the beta-adrenoceptor blockersClass III antiarrhythmic agents include sotalol and amiodarone.Class IV antiarrhythmic drugs are the calcium channel blockers verapamil and diltiazem. Other agents which do not fall neatly into the Vaughan Williams classification include digoxin and perhexiline.Antiarrhythmic drugs can be divided into four Vaughan Williams classes (I-IV) according to defined electrophysiological effects on the myocardium.Thus, the Vaughan Williams classification also coincides with the main myocardial targets of the antiarrhythmics, i.e., myocardial sodium-, potassium-, and calcium-channels or beta-adrenergic receptors. The sodium-channel blockade induced by class-I substances is enhanced with increasing heart rates. Thus, class-I antiarrhythmics can be subclassified as substances showing a more exponential, an approximately linear, or rather saturated block-frequency relation.Class-III antiarrhythmics (potassium-channel blockade) can be further differentiated according to the component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IK) which is inhibited by a drug. Class-III substances inhibiting the slowly activating IKs component are currently under investigation and are expected to show a direct rate dependence.Antiarrhythmic agents are traditionally classified according to Vaughan Williams into four classes of action. Class I antiarrhythmic agents include most of the drugs traditionally thought of as antiarrhythmics, and have as a common action, blockade of the fast-inward sodium channel on myocardium. Antiarrhythmic drugs can be divided into four Vaughan Williams classes (I-IV) according to defined electrophysiological effects on the myocardiumThe classification of antiarrhythmic agents according to Vaughan Williams is based on electrophysiological findings in isolated heart muscle and defines four classes of drug actions.Antiarrhythmic agents are traditionally classified according to Vaughan Williams into four classes of action. Class I antiarrhythmic agents include most of the drugs traditionally thought of as antiarrhythmics, and have as a common action, blockade of the fast-inward sodium channel on myocardium.Class II agents are antisympathetic drugs, particularly the b-adrenoceptor blockers.Class III antiarrhythmic agents include sotalol and amiodarone. Class IV antiarrhythmic drugs are the calcium channel blockers verapamil and diltiazem. These are classified according to their electrophysiological effects observed in isolated cardiac tissues in vitro (Vaughan Williams, 1989). Fast sodium channel blockers (class I) which reduce the upstroke velocity of the action potential are usually subclassified into three groups, class I A-C, according to their effect on the action potential duration. Beta-adrenergic antagonists (class II) exert their effects by antagonizing the electrophysiological effects of beta-adrenergic catecholamines. Class III antiarrhythmic agents (eg amiodarone) prolong the action potential and slow calcium channel blockers (class IV) suppress the calcium inward current and calcium-dependent action potentials. \"}, {\"question\": \"Which are the different isoforms of the mammalian Notch receptor?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, used to regulate cell fate decisions.

In cardiac muscle, junctin forms a quaternary protein complex with the ryanodine receptor (RyR), calsequestrin, and triadin 1 at the luminal face of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (jSR). By binding directly the RyR and calsequestrin, junctin may mediate the Ca(2+)-dependent regulatory interactions between both proteins.Calsequestrin, the major calcium sequestering protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle, forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor calcium release channel and the intrinsic membrane proteins triadin and junctin. Junctin is a transmembrane protein of the cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that binds to the ryanodine receptor, calsequestrin, and triadin 1. This quaternary protein complex is thought to facilitate SR Ca2+ release.In mammalian striated muscles, ryanodine receptor (RyR), triadin, junctin, and calsequestrin form a quaternary complex in the lumen of sarcoplasmic reticulum. Such intermolecular interactions contribute not only to the passive buffering of sarcoplasmic reticulum luminal Ca2+, but also to the active Ca2+ release process during excitation-contraction coupling. Junctin is a major transmembrane protein in cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum, which forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor (Ca(2+) release channel), triadin, and calsequestrin. Triadin 1 is a major transmembrane protein in cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor (Ca(2+) release channel), junctin, and calsequestrin.Several key proteins have been localized to junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum which are important for Ca2+ release. These include the ryanodine receptor, triadin, and calsequestrin, which may associate into a stable complex at the junctional membrane. We recently purified and cloned a fourth component of this complex, junctin, which exhibits homology with triadin and is the major 125I-calsequestrin-binding protein detected in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesiclesBy a combination of approaches including calsequestrin-affinity chromatography, filter overlay, immunoprecipitation assays, and fusion protein binding analyses, we find that junctin binds directly to calsequestrin, triadin, and the ryanodine receptor.

Overall, there is compelling evidence that salivary TDM can be usefully applied so as to optimize the treatment of epilepsy with carbamazepine, clobazam, ethosuximide, gabapentin, lacosamide, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, topiramate, and zonisamide.The first examples are carbamazepine, gabapentin, and lacosamide as drugs well established in epilepsy market as well as drug candidates such as valnoctamide, and other valproic acid derivatives, novel biphenyl pyrazole derivatives, etc.Two additional AEDs, lacosamide and eslicarbazepine acetate, have been licensed recently for a more traditional indication, refractory partial-onset seizures. A discussion is made of recent findings that the atypical antidepressant tianeptine increases CRMP2 expression, whereas other, neuroactive small molecules including the epilepsy drug lacosamide and the natural brain metabolite lanthionine ketimine appear to bind CRMP2 directly with concomitant affects on neural structure.Lacosamide (LCM) is a newer antiepileptic drug with a dual mode of action. It has shown potent and broad neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo animal models making it a potential candidate for long term treatment of epilepsy. In addition to this, it has demonstrated analgesic activity in various animal models. Apart from this, LCM has demonstrated potent effects in animal models for a variety of CNS disorders like schizophrenia and stress induced anxiety. Clinical trials have also suggested that LCM is a safe, effective, and well tolerated adjunctive treatment for reduction of seizure frequency in patients with highly refractory, partial seizures.Lacosamide (LCM), (SPM 927, (R)-2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide, previously referred to as harkoseride or ADD 234037) is a member of a series of functionalized amino acids that were specifically synthesized as anticonvulsive drug candidates. LCM has demonstrated antiepileptic effectiveness in different rodent seizure models and antinociceptive potential in experimental animal models that reflect distinct types and symptoms of neuropathic as well as chronic inflammatory pain.Recent results suggest that LCM has a dual mode of action underlying its anticonvulsant and analgesic activity.Currently, LCM is in a late stage of clinical development as an adjunctive treatment for patients with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures, and it is being assessed as monotherapy in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy. Lacosamide was effective against sound-induced seizures in the genetically susceptible Frings mouse, against maximal electroshock test (MES)-induced seizures in rats and mice, in the rat hippocampal kindling model of partial seizures, and in the 6Hz model of psychomotor seizures in mice.Lacosamide was inactive against clonic seizures induced by subcutaneous administration of the chemoconvulsants pentylenetetrazol, bicuculline, and picrotoxin, but it did inhibit NMDA-induced seizures in mice and showed full efficacy in the homocysteine model of epilepsy.These results suggest that lacosamide may have the potential to be clinically useful for at least the treatment of generalized tonic-clonic and partial-onset epilepsies, and support ongoing clinical trials in these indications.\"}, {\"question\": \"List Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Triad.\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a clinical syndrome characterized by the triad of anaemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure.\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"anaemia\"], [\"thrombocytopenia\"], [\"renal failure\"]], \"context\": \"Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a clinical syndrome characterized by the triad of thrombotic microangiopathy, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury.Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare disease characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure.Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a relatively rare disorder described by the triad of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure.Until recently, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), conventionally defined in the pediatric literature as a syndrome of the triad of renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia without a prodrome of hemorrhagic diarrhea, has received little attention in adult practice because the patients are commonly given the diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or TTP/HUS and treated as TTP with plasma exchange, augmented in refractory cases with rituximab and sometimes even splenectomy.

A mutation in TNNC1-encoded cardiac troponin C, TNNC1-A31S, predisposes to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and ventricular fibrillation.Here, we report clinical and functional characterization of a novel TNNC1 mutation, A31S, identified in a pediatric HCM proband with multiple episodes of ventricular fibrillation and aborted sudden cardiac death.In summary, we report a novel mutation in the TNNC1 gene that is associated with HCM pathogenesis and may predispose to the pathogenesis of a fatal arrhythmogenic subtype of HCM.The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-linked A8V and E134D mutations in cardiac troponin C (cTnC) on the response of reconstituted thin filaments to calcium upon phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) by protein kinase A.We describe a novel type of mutation (c.363dupG) in Troponin C, a rare form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.We report the first frameshift mutation (c.363dupG or p.Gln122AlafsX30) in Troponin C causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (and sudden cardiac death) in a 19-year-old male, and have demonstrated that the mutation segregates with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy within the family.One mutant (A23Q) was found with HCM-like properties (increased Ca(2+) sensitivity of force and normal levels of ATPase inhibition).In this study, we investigated the effects of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-linked mutations A8V, E134D, and D145E in cardiac troponin C on the properties of the C-domain sites.Recently four new hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations in cardiac troponin C (cTnC) (A8V, C84Y, E134D, and D145E) were reported, and their effects on the Ca(2+) sensitivity of force development were evaluatedComprehensive open reading frame/splice site mutation analysis of TNNC1 performed on 1025 unrelated HCM patients enrolled over the last 10 years revealed novel missense mutations in TNNC1: A8V, C84Y, E134D, and D145E.The cardiac troponin C (cTnC) mutation, L29Q, has been found in a patient with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.These results demonstrate that the L29Q mutation enhances the Ca(2+)-binding characteristics of cTnC and that when incorporated into cardiac myocytes, this mutant alters myocyte contractility.Cardiac troponin C-L29Q, related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hinders the transduction of the protein kinase A dependent phosphorylation signal from cardiac troponin I to C.This mutation leads to a leucine-glutamine exchange at position 29 in the nonfunctional calcium-binding site of cTnC. \"}, {\"question\": \"Which post-translational histone modifications are characteristic of constitutive heterochromatin?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"H3K9me3 is the major marker of constitutive heterochromatin.

In an initial approach, the procedure accurately discriminates susceptible, intermediate and resistant strains of Escherichia coli to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.Surprisingly, also cinnamycin of Streptomyces cinnamoneus cinnamoneus), previously known to bind specifically to phosphatidylethanolamin of biological membranes, provoked strong cell wall biosynthetic stress.Here, we compare the staining patterns observed in Bacillus subtilis using fluorescent derivatives of two PG-binding antibiotics, vancomycin and ramoplanin.Ramoplanin probes may be better imaging agents than vancomycin probes because they yield clear staining patterns at concentrations well below their minimum inhibitory concentrations.Structures of the muraymycins, novel peptidoglycan biosynthesis inhibitors.The muraymycins constitute a new antibiotic family whose core structure contains a glycosylated uronic acid derivative joined by an aminopropane group to a hexahydro-2-imino-4-pyrimidylglycyl residue (epicapreomycidine) containing dipeptide that is further extended by a urea-valine moiety.The muraymycins inhibited peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Rethinking ramoplanin: the role of substrate binding in inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis.Ramoplanin is a cyclicdepsipeptide antibiotic that inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis.Vancomycin binds to bacterial cell-wall intermediates to achieve its antibiotic effect.The lantibiotic mersacidin inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis at the level of transglycosylation.The lantibiotic mersacidin has been previously reported to interfere with bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesisHere, we focus on the target reaction and describe a mersacidin-induced accumulation of UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide, indicating that inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis occurs after the formation of cytoplasmic precursorsThe analogy to the glycopeptides may hint at an interaction of mersacidin with the peptidoglycan precursor rather than with the enzyme. Unlike vancomycin however, mersacidin inhibits peptidoglycan formation from UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-tripeptide and is active against Enterococcus faecium expressing the vanA resistance gene cluster.Inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis in vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant bacteria by a semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotic.LY191145 is a p-chlorobenzyl derivative of LY264826 (A82846B) with activity against both vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococci. Incorporation of L-[14C]lysine into peptidoglycan of intact vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecium was inhibited by LY191145 (50% inhibitory concentrations of 1 and 5 microgram/ml, respectively). Inhibition was accompanied by accumulation of UDP-muramyl-peptide precursors in the cytoplasmThe fact that inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis by LY191145 was not readily antagonized by an excess of free acyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine or acyl-D-alanyl-D-lactate ligands indicates that the manner in which this compound inhibits transglycosylation may not be identical to that of vancomycin.Comparison with tunicamycin-treated cells indicated that peptidoglycan rather than teichoic acid metabolism is primarily affectedMersacidin caused the excretion of a putative cell wall precursor into the culture supernatantMode of action of the lantibiotic mersacidin: inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis via a novel mechanism?Mersacidin is an antibiotic peptide produced by Bacillus sp. strain HIL Y-85,54728 that belongs to the group of lantibiotics. Its activity in vivo against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains compares with that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycinIncubation of Staphylococcus simulans 22 with mersacidin resulted in the cessation of growth and slow lysis.n contrast to vancomycin, the activity of mersacidin was not antagonized by the tripeptide diacetyl-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala, indicating that on the molecular level its mode of action differs from those of glycopeptide antibiotics.Inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis by ramoplanin.Ramoplanin, a new lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, inhibits cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in gram-positive bacteria.Bacitracin and other antibiotics that inhibit late stages in peptidoglycan biosynthesis induce vancomycin resistance in a high-level, inducibly vancomycin-resistant strain of Enterococcus faecium.This effect does not involve a change in the permeability of the cell wall by this drug and is consistent with the identification of D-alanine racemase as a target of D-cycloserine. CONCLUSIONS: Several pathways and genes downregulated by fosfomycin have been identified, in contrast to previously described cell wall active antibiotics, and was explained by starvation response induced by phosphoenolpyruvate accumulation. The target pathway - peptidoglycan biosynthesis - was upregulated following fosfomycin treatment. Ramoplanin, a new lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, inhibits cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in gram-positive bacteria. Fosfomycin inhibited the first enzymatic step of peptidoglycan synthesis, which was followed by decreased levels of peptidoglycan precursors but enhanced levels of substrates such as UDP-GlcNAc and alanine-alanine.In contrast, vancomycin and ampicillin inhibited the last stage of peptidoglycan construction on the outer cell surface.The target pathway - peptidoglycan biosynthesis - was upregulated following fosfomycin treatment. Modulation of transport processes, cofactor biosynthesis, energy metabolism and nucleic acid biosynthesis was also observed.Ramoplanin, a new lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, inhibits cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in gram-positive bacteria.\"}, {\"question\": \"List two common features of Tay syndrome.\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Tay syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by congenital ichthyosis and trichothiodystrophy (abnormal brittle hair).

Photosensitive cases are also identified as PIBIDS (photosensitivity with IBIDS). Cases without manifest ichthyosis are also identified as PBIDS. These syndromes defy rigorous definition because of clinical variation between patients. The original two cases were described by Tay in oriental siblings, whose parents were first cousins; thus the disease is also known as Tay syndrome. Tay syndrome or IBIDS is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by congenital ichthyosis and abnormal brittle hair (trichothiodystrophy). Other features include photosensitivity, abnormal nails and multiple developmental defects affecting organs mainly derived from neuroectoderm. We report a case of trichothiodystrophy initially classified as Tay syndrome that based on clinical features, complementary exams as well as on the disease evolution was labelled as PIBIDS syndrome.Tay-syndrome is a rare monogen-inherited ektodermal dysplastic syndrome with ichtyosis, fragility of the hair and physical and mental retardation. The congenital ichtyosis is ubiquitous. Only the skin on the flexion side of the extremity joints are not involved (orthocerathosis combined with paraceratotic strings).In Tay syndrome, the trichothiodystrophy is accompanied by congenital ichthyosis, short stature, delayed physical and mental development and pyramidal tract signs with increase in muscular tone and brisk tendon reflexes. We present a case of Tay syndrome in which a cranial MRI revealed an almost total lack of myelin within the cerebral hemispheres and a patchy hypomyelination of the cerebellum. In accordance, a strongly prolonged visual evoked response pointed to a dysfunction of the white matter in Tay syndrome.For example, the brittle hair due to sulphur deficiency (trichothiodystrophy) is nowadays regarded as genetically heterogeneous; three different syndromes can be distinguished: BIDS syndrome, Tay syndrome, and PIBIDS syndrome. The Tay syndrome (congenital ichthyosis with trichothiodystrophy).The Tay syndrome is a distinct type of congenital ichthyosis characterized by a peculiar anomaly of hair growth which has been termed trichothiodystrophy.

Phosphorylation of the chromodomain of Cbx2 on this residue in vitro resulted in a reduced level of binding to an H3 peptide containing trimethylated lysine-9 as well as an increase in the extent of binding to an H3 peptide containing trimethylated lysine-27, suggesting that such phosphorylation changes the binding specificity of Cbx2 for modified histone H3. Phosphorylation of the chromodomain of Cbx2 may therefore serve as a molecular switch that affects the reading of the histone modification code and thereby controls epigenetic cellular memory.Here we identify the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 8 (CHD8) as a novel coregulator of androgen-responsive transcription.Mutations in CHD7, a chromodomain gene, are present in a majority of individuals with CHARGE syndrome, a multiple anomaly disorder characterized by ocular Coloboma, Heart defects, Atresia of the choanae, Retarded growth and development, Genital hypoplasia and Ear anomalies.Two new chromodomain-containing proteins that associate with heterochromatin in Sciara coprophila chromosomes.Both proteins, ScoHET1 of 37 kDa and ScoHET2 of 44 kDa, display two chromodomain motifs that contain the conserved residues essential for the recognition of methylated histone H3 at lysine 9.In this study, we present a detailed histomorphologic characterization of mice containing a mutation in the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 2 (Chd2).Specificity of the chromodomain Y chromosome family of chromodomains for lysine-methylated ARK(S/T) motifs.Previous studies have shown two homologous chromodomain modules in the HP1 and Polycomb proteins exhibit discriminatory binding to related methyllysine residues (embedded in ARKS motifs) of the histone H3 tail.In vertebrates, HP1-like chromodomains are also present in the chromodomain Y chromosome (CDY) family of proteins adjacent to a putative catalytic motif. The human genome encodes three CDY family proteins, CDY, CDYL, and CDYL2.The CDY chromodomain exhibits discriminatory binding to lysine-methylated ARK(S/T) motifs, whereas the CDYL2 chromodomain binds with comparable strength to multiple ARK(S/T) motifs. Interestingly, subtle amino acid changes in the CDYL chromodomain prohibit such binding interactions in vitro and in vivo.We assessed mRNA transcript abundance of seven genes that code for proteins with established roles in epigenetically-mediated gene silencing [transcriptional co-repressor SIN3A, DNA (cytosine-5-) methyltransferase 1, methyl CpG binding protein 2, chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 4, histone binding protein rbbp4, histone deacetylase 1 and nuclear receptor co-repressor 2] using qRT-PCR.CHD7 is a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA binding domain (CHD) family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes.The cysteine-rich CXXC domains of MBD1 bound to Ring1b and the chromodomain of hPc2.Methylation of lysine 9 within histone H3 and the subsequent binding of the chromodomain protein heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) are thought to initiate heterochromatin formation in vivo and to propagate a heterochromatic state lasting through several cell divisions.Here, we show that the SNF2-like chromodomain helicase protein CHD8 interacts with the insulator binding protein CTCF.

The protein was studied by bioinformatic means and classified as a member of the third subfamily of chromodomain helicase DNA-binding proteins (CHD). In silico translation defined CReMM as a multiple domains protein including two chromodomains, SNF2/ATPase, helicase C domain and an A/T-DNA-binding domain (DBD).Identification and analysis of chromodomain-containing proteins encoded in the mouse transcriptome.The chromodomain is 40-50 amino acids in length and is conserved in a wide range of chromatic and regulatory proteins involved in chromatin remodeling. Chromodomain-containing proteins can be classified into families based on their broader characteristics, in particular the presence of other types of domains, and which correlate with different subclasses of the chromodomains themselves.Here we show that the chromodomain of CMT3 can directly interact with the N-terminal tail of histone H3, but only when it is simultaneously methylated at both the H3K9 and H3K27 positions.In addition to the canonical MYST HAT catalytic domain, both TgMYST-A and -B possess an atypical C2HC zinc finger and a chromodomain.Clr7 and Clr8 are required for localization of the Swi6 chromodomain protein and for histone H3 lysine 9 methylation, thereby influencing not only mating-type switching but also transcriptional silencing in all previously characterized heterochromatic regions, chromosome segregation, and meiotic recombination in the mating-type region.MRG15, a novel chromodomain protein, is present in two distinct multiprotein complexes involved in transcriptional activation.MRG15 is a novel chromodomain protein that is a member of a family of genes related to MORF4. MORF4 (mortality factor on chromosome 4) induces senescence in a subset of human tumor cell lines.Analysis of deletion mutants of MRG15 indicated that the leucine zipper at the C-terminal region of MRG15 was important for the protein associations in MAF1 and that the N-terminal chromodomain was required for the assembly of the MAF2 protein complex. Consistent with these data was the fact that a histone acetyltransferase activity associated with MRG15 was lost when the chromodomain was deleted and that both mutant MRG15 proteins failed to activate the B-myb promoter. The various mechanisms by which MRG15 could activate gene transcription are discussed.The chromodomain (CD) is a highly conserved motif present in a variety of animal and plant proteins, and its probable role is to assemble a variety of macromolecular complexes in chromatin.Structure of HP1 chromodomain bound to a lysine 9-methylated histone H3 tail.The chromodomain of the HP1 family of proteins recognizes histone tails with specifically methylated lysines. Here, we present structural, energetic, and mutational analyses of the complex between the Drosophila HP1 chromodomain and the histone H3 tail with a methyllysine at residue 9, a modification associated with epigenetic silencing. The histone tail inserts as a beta strand, completing the beta-sandwich architecture of the chromodomain. The methylammonium group is caged by three aromatic side chains, whereas adjacent residues form discerning contacts with one face of the chromodomain.The MORF4-Related Gene on chromosome 15 (MRG15) is a member of a novel family of genes originally identified in studies to reveal cell senescence-inducing factors. MRG15 contains several predicted protein motifs, including a nuclear localization signal, a helix-loop-helix region, a leucine zipper, and a chromodomain.Four alleles of dMi-2 mutants were further characterized in molecular nature; dMi-2(BL1) was found to have a mutation in the ATP-binding motif of the ATPase domain, dMi-2(BL7) in the core histidine of the first plant homeodomain zinc finger and dMi-2(BL12) in a conserved serine in the chromodomain.These analyses also suggest that the msl-3/MRG15 duplication occurred after the fungus/animal split, while an independent duplication occurred in plants. The proteins encoded by these genes have similar structures, including a putative chromodomain close to their N-terminal end and a putative leucine zipper at their C-terminus.CHD1 interacts with SSRP1 and depends on both its chromodomain and its ATPase/helicase-like domain for proper association with chromatin.Interaction between an integral protein of the nuclear envelope inner membrane and human chromodomain proteins homologous to Drosophila HP1.A mammalian DNA-binding protein that contains a chromodomain and an SNF2/SWI2-like helicase domain.A Southern blot analysis indicated that this protein, which we have named CHD-1, for chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein, is present in most, if not all, mammalian species.Here we show that chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (Chd4) forms a complex with Gata3 in Th2 cells that both activates Th2 cytokine transcription and represses the Th1 cytokine IFN-\\u03b3.Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4), the defining subunit of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, is a nucleosome-remodeling protein of the SNF2/ISWI2 family, members of which contain two chromo domains and an ATP-dependent helicase module.Among those proteins with >40% regulation were Macrophage Capping protein (CAPG) and Chromodomain Helicase DNA binding protein 4 (CHD4) proteins which were significantly upregulated by pp32r1 and pp32r1Y140H overexpression.This heterochromatin coordinates expression levels by associating with a chromodomain protein Chp1 and an antisilencing factor Epe1.Within NCCs, Brg1 partners with chromatin remodeler Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 7 (Chd7) on the PlexinA2 promoter to activate PlexinA2, which encodes a receptor for semaphorin to guide NCCs into the OFT.Chromodomain Helicase DNA binding protein 5 (CHD5) is a tumor suppressor mapping to 1p36, a genomic region that is frequently deleted in human cancer.Here, we identify ENHANCED PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (EPP1), previously known as PICKLE (PKL), an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor of the chromodomain/helicase/DNA binding family, as a repressor of photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana.Chromodomain on Y-like (CDYL) is a chromodomain protein that has sequence homology to members of the enoyl CoA hydratase family.Our previous structural work demonstrated that a coiled-coil interaction between MBD2 and GATA zinc finger domain containing 2A (GATAD2A/p66\\u03b1) proteins recruits the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein (CHD4/Mi2\\u03b2) to the NuRD complex and is necessary for MBD2-mediated DNA methylation-dependent gene silencing in vivo (Gnanapragasam, M.

has been shown that the methylation mark of vertebrate histone H1 is specifically recognized by the chromodomain of HP1.To this end, we have performed mutation studies on the Drosophila HP1\\u03b1 chromodomain, which binds H3K9Me(2)  and H3K9Me(3)  with approximately equal affinities.We are interested in defining which elements of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 (Chd1) remodeler are necessary and sufficient for sliding nucleosomes.Chromatin remodelers are ATP-dependent machines that dynamically alter the chromatin packaging of eukaryotic genomes by assembling, sliding, and displacing nucleosomes.Ocular coloboma, heart malformation, choanal atresia, retardation of growth and/or development, genital hypoplasia, and ear anomalies associated with deafness (CHARGE) syndrome is a rare, usually sporadic, autosomal dominant disorder, caused by mutations within the CHD7 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7) gene, in nearly 70% of cases.Here we report that the chromodomain-containing protein CDYL specifically recognizes di- and tri-methylated H3K27 (H3K27me2 and H3K27me3) and directly interacts with EZH2, the catalytic subunit of PRC2.Murine Chd1 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1), a chromodomain-containing chromatin remodeling protein, is necessary for embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency.Among those genes, zinc finger helicase (ZFH), also termed chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 3 (Chd3), was one of the highly expressed transcripts in tentative cementoblasts.UNLABELLED: Emerging evidence implicates the chromodomain helicase/ATPase DNA binding protein 1-like gene (CHD1L) as a specific oncogene in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Here, we investigate the function of chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 (chd7) during zebrafish somitogenesis.Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding chromodomain-DNA-binding-protein 7 (CHD7) cause CHARGE syndrome, a multiple anomaly condition which includes vestibular dysfunction and hearing loss.BACKGROUND: The CHD5 gene located on 1p36 encodes a protein-chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 5. CHD5 has been shown to be a tumor suppressor gene candidate.Because, in plants, DNA methylation can serve as a signal for H3-lysine9-dimethylation (H3K9me2), and subsequently for non-CG-context DNA methylation, SET-domain histone methyltransferase and chromodomain dna methyltransferase 3 (cmt3) mutations were introgressed.Previously, we have shown that the chromodomain protein Chriz and the zinc-finger protein Z4 are essentially required for the maintenance of polytene chromosome structure.In brain, Family with sequence similarity 174 member b (Fam174b) had increased expression in 318 females, whereas Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 2 (Chd2-2) had reduced expression in 318 males.RESULTS: Here we demonstrated that chromobox protein homolog 3 (Cbx3) is crucial for SMC differentiation from stem cells and that the chromodomain and chromoshadow domain of Cbx3 are responsible for Cbx3-induced SMC differentiation.Fractionation of the extract identified a single protein, chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1 (Chd1), capable of the remodeling activity.Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 5 (CHD5) has been found to be a candidate tumor suppressor gene (TSG) in malignant neural tumors.Similarly, CenH3-GFP distribution was altered in the absence of HP1, the chromodomain protein that binds to H3K9me3.ChIP-Seq reveals that KDM5B is predominantly targeted to intragenic regions and that it is recruited to H3K36me3 via an interaction with the chromodomain protein MRG15.OBJECTIVE: Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein (CHD) is a regulator of the chromatin remodelling process.We determined the crystal structure of MPP8 chromodomain in complex with H3K9me3 peptide.On this gene the chromodomain protein HP1\\u03b3, frequently defined as a transcriptional repressor, facilitates inclusion of the alternative exons via a mechanism involving decreased RNA polymerase II elongation rate.Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) is a core component of the NuRD complex and contains a nucleosome remodeling ATPase domain along with two chromodomains and two plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers.H3-Lys-9-Me2 interacts with the chromodomain of Swi6/HP1.The chromodomain (CD) of HP1 proteins specifically recognizes the methyl mark on H3 peptides, but the same extent of specificity is not observed within chromatin.We have performed simulations on models of chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 complexed with a variety of histone H3 modifications.CHARGE syndrome is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder caused by mutation in the CHD7 gene, encoding chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7. Molecular diagnostic testing for CHD7 mutation has been available in a clinical setting since 2005.In this work we identified Kismet, a chromodomain-containing protein of the SNF2-like family of ATPases, as a novel component of the hedgehog transcriptional repression mechanism in anterior compartment cells.\"}, {\"question\": \"Are there drugs for Tick-borne Encephalitis?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"No drug therapy available today\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"No drug therapy available today\"]], \"context\": \" tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) have been detected in Bulgaria. Considering the remarkable increase in TBE morbidity in Europe over the past two decades, we conducted a study of TBE among patients with acute viral meningitis who were hospitalised in Bulgaria during 2009 to 2012. Viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae family primarily spread through arthropod vectors, and are the major causes of illness and death around the globe. The Flaviviridae family consists of 3 genera which include the Flavivirus genus (type species, yellow fever virus) as the largest genus, the Hepacivirus (type species, hepatitis C virus) and the Pestivirus (type species, bovine virus diarrhea). The flaviviruses (Flavivirus genus) are small RNA viruses transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks that take over host cell machinery in order to propagate. However, hepaciviruses and pestiviruses are not antropod-borne.

PLN mutation carriers more often had low-voltage electrocardiograms (p\\u00a0= 0.004), inverted T waves in leads V4 to V6 (p <0.001), and additional structural (p\\u00a0= 0.007) or functional (p\\u00a0= 0.017) left ventricular impairment, whereas desmosomal mutation carriers had more solitary right ventricular abnormalities.Recently, we showed that the c.40_42delAGA (p.Arg14del) mutation in the phospholamban (PLN) gene can be identified in 10-15\\u00a0% of Dutch patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.PLN mutation R14del was identified in 12 (12 %) ARVC patients and in 39 (15 %) DCM patients. The PLN R14del founder mutation is present in a substantial number of patients clinically diagnosed with DCM or ARVC. R14del+ patients diagnosed with DCM showed an arrhythmogenic phenotype, and SCD at young age can be the presenting symptom. These findings support the concept of 'arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy'.Herein we reveal mechanistic insight into how four hereditary mutants of phospholamban, Arg(9) to Cys, Arg(9) to Leu, Arg(9) to His, and Arg(14) deletion, alter regulation of SERCA. Deletion of Arg(14) disrupts the protein kinase A recognition motif, which abrogates phospholamban phosphorylation and results in constitutive SERCA inhibition. Mutation of Arg(9) causes more complex changes in function, where hydrophobic substitutions such as cysteine and leucine eliminate both SERCA inhibition and phospholamban phosphorylation, whereas an aromatic substitution such as histidine selectively disrupts phosphorylation. We demonstrate that the role of Arg(9) in phospholamban function is multifaceted: it is important for inhibition of SERCA, it increases the efficiency of phosphorylation, and it is critical for protein kinase A recognition in the context of the phospholamban pentamer. Given the synergistic consequences on contractility, it is not surprising that the mutants cause lethal, hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy.Phospholamban (PLN) is a key regulator of SR and cardiac function, and PLN mutations in humans have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We previously reported the deletion of the highly conserved amino acid residue arginine 14 (nucleic acids 39, 40 and 41) in DCM patients.To assess the function of this mutant PLN, we introduced the PLN-R14Del in cardiac myocytes of the PLN null mouse.Thus, human PLN-R14Del is misrouted to the sarcolemma, in the absence of endogenous PLN, and alters NKA activity, leading to cardiac remodeling.Mutations in the gene encoding PLN have been associated with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy; however, no systematic search for PLN mutations in heart failure has been conducted.Two patients presented a G-T missense mutation at the G26 nucleotide, which encodes an Arg-Leu substitution at codon 9 (R9L).One patient presented a G-A missense mutation at the same nucleotide, which encodes an Arg-His substitution at codon 9 (R9H). The fourth affected patient presented a T-G nonsense mutation at the nucleotide 116, substituting a termination codon for Leu-39 (L39stop).The genetic analysis was focused on R9C mutation with the ability to block PLN phosphorylation leading to chronic inhibition of SERCA2a activity. Another analysed mutation causing the alteration of PLN level in cells was related to the substitution of a leucine residue at position 39 with a premature stop codon (L39X). A missense mutation in PLN cytoplasmic domain (R9C) triggers dilated cardiomyopathy in humans, leading to premature death. These effects are enhanced under oxidizing conditions, suggesting that oxidative stress may exacerbate the cardiotoxic effects of the PLN(R9C) mutant. We identified 1 family with a deletion of arginine 14 in the PLN. Interestingly, unlike other individuals reported with the identical PLN mutation, these individuals were not diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy until their seventh decade when they were only mildly symptomatic with congestive heart failure. Phospholamban R14 deletion results in late-onset, mild, hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy.Through genetic screening of dilated cardiomyopathy patients, we identified a previously uncharacterized deletion of arginine 14 (PLN-R14Del) in the coding region of the phospholamban (PLN) gene in a large family with hereditary heart failure. No homozygous individuals were identified. By middle age, heterozygous individuals developed left ventricular dilation, contractile dysfunction, and episodic ventricular arrhythmias, with overt heart failure in some cases.Transgenic mice overexpressing the mutant PLN-R14Del recapitulated human cardiomyopathy exhibiting similar histopathologic abnormalities and premature death.A mutation in the human phospholamban gene, deleting arginine 14, results in lethal, hereditary cardiomyopathy.Here, a T116G point mutation, substituting a termination codon for Leu-39 (L39stop), was identified in two families with hereditary heart failure. The heterozygous individuals exhibited hypertrophy without diminished contractile performance. Strikingly, both individuals homozygous for L39stop developed dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure, requiring cardiac transplantation at ages 16 and 27. Here we report that an inherited human dilated cardiomyopathy with refractory congestive heart failure is caused by a dominant Arg --> Cys missense mutation at residue 9 (R9C) in phospholamban (PLN), a transmembrane phosphoprotein that inhibits the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA2a) pump. Transgenic PLN(R9C) mice recapitulated human heart failure with premature death. Cellular and biochemical studies revealed that, unlike wild-type PLN, PLN(R9C) did not directly inhibit SERCA2a. Rather, PLN(R9C) trapped protein kinase A (PKA), which blocked PKA-mediated phosphorylation of wild-type PLN and in turn delayed decay of calcium transients in myocytes.

The potential benefits of supplement use in athletes are thus questionable. Some studies indicate no benefits, while others highlight potential negative side effects of vitamin supplementation. These data indicate that RQ significantly reduces exercise-induced lipid peroxidation without associated changes in inflammation or plasma antioxidant status.Cr supplementation inhibited the increase of inflammation markers TNF-\\u03b1 and CRP, but not oxidative stress markers, due to acute exercise.Quercetin and vitamin C supplementation may not be beneficial in lipid profile improvement, although it may reduce induce muscle damage and body fat percent.Vitamins C and E supplementation had no significant effect on any of the studied parameters.Effects of the two treatments relative to placebo on mean performance in the incremental test and time trial were unclear, but runners faster by 1 SD of peak speed demonstrated a possible improvement on peak running speed with BC juice (1.9%; \\u00b12.5%).

Supplementation with antioxidant vitamin E to athletes at 267 mg (400 IUs) or greater has been reported to reduce levels of LP associated with exercise.Results obtained at the end of the study indicate that zinc supplementation prevents production of free radicals by activating the antioxidant system.The significant increase in the UI of erythrocyte membranes indicates the potential for harm, because a high intake of PUFA might increase susceptibility to lipid peroxidation not counterbalanced by a higher increase in TAA.

Nuclear marginalization of host cell chromatin associated with expansion of two discrete virus-induced subnuclear compartments during baculovirus infectionIn the late stage of infection, however, the peristromal region (PR), another virus-induced subnuclear compartment, was also excluded from the chromatin-localizing area.This correlation between compartmentalization and chromatin exclusion suggests the possibility that a chromatin-exclusive property of viral molecules, at least in part, supports nuclear compartmentalization of virus-infected cells.Chromatin modifications in hematopoietic multipotent and committed progenitors are independent of gene subnuclear positioning relative to repressive compartmentsTo further clarify the contribution of nuclear architecture in the regulation of gene expression patterns during differentiation of human multipotent cells, we analyzed expression status, histone modifications, and subnuclear positioning relative to repressive compartments, of hematopoietic loci in multipotent and lineage-committed primary human hematopoietic progenitors.We report here that positioning of lineage-affiliated loci relative to pericentromeric heterochromatin compartments (PCH) is identical in multipotent cells from various origins and is unchanged between multipotent and lineage-committed hematopoietic progenitors. The complexity in composition and function of the eukaryotic nucleus is achieved through its organization in specialized nuclear compartments.Cohesin-based chromatin interactions enable regulated gene expression within preexisting architectural compartments.Chromosome conformation capture approaches have shown that interphase chromatin is partitioned into spatially segregated Mb-sized compartments and sub-Mb-sized topological domains. This compartmentalization is thought to facilitate the matching of genes and regulatory elements,we find that architectural compartments are maintained in noncycling mouse thymocytes after genetic depletion of cohesin in vivoOur findings indicate that cohesin-mediated long-range interactions facilitate discrete gene expression states within preexisting chromosomal compartmentsHistone posttranslational modifications mediate establishment of structurally and functionally distinct chromatin compartments of eukaryotic nuclei.Recent studies employing chromatin conformation capture techniques indicate that Hox clusters adopt a remarkable spatial configuration, in which active and inactive genes are segregated into two distinct chromatin compartments.Recent Hi-C mapping has unveiled substructure within chromatin compartments called topologically associating domains (TADs) that are largely conserved in their positions between cell types and are similar in size to replication domains.Interaction of SP100 with HP1 proteins: a link between the promyelocytic leukemia-associated nuclear bodies and the chromatin compartment.We propose that basically three nuclear compartments exist, an &quot;open&quot; higher-order chromatin compartment with chromatin domains containing active genes, a &quot;closed&quot; chromatin compartment comprising inactive genes, and an interchromatin domain (ICD) compartment (Cremer et al., 1993; Zirbel et al., 1993) that contains macromolecular complexes for transcription, splicing, DNA replication, and repair.

Furthermore, the current literature on familial MMD has pointed to a low penetrance autosomal dominant or polygenic mode of transmittance at loci on chromosomes 3, 6, 8, 12, and 17.Here, we report on three unrelated families affected with an X-linked moyamoya syndrome characterized by the association of a moyamoya angiopathy, short stature, and a stereotyped facial dysmorphism. We show that this syndromic moyamoya is caused by Xq28 deletions removing MTCP1/MTCP1NB and BRCC3. A genome-wide association study of 785,720 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed, comparing 72 Japanese MMD patients with 45 Japanese controls and resulting in a strong association of chromosome 17q25-ter with MMD risk. This result was further confirmed by a locus-specific association study using 335 SNPs in the 17q25-ter region. Investigations included neuroimaging, cardiologic and ophthalmologic evaluation, hormonal testing, hemoglobin electrophoresis, chromosomal karyotyping, muscle biopsy for morphology, immunohistochemistry and enzyme assays, mtDNA mutation screening, and haplotype analysis of 2 loci previously linked to moyamoya, on chromosomes 10 (ACTA2) and 17.These data strongly suggest that this family is affected by a hereditary moyamoya multisystem disorder with X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance.Her features were consistent with TS and chromosome analysis revealed mosaicism in which 17% of the cells showed a pseudoisodicentric Y chromosome: 45,X (25)/46,X psu idic (Y)(11.2) (5). The small number of cases does not allow detailed analysis other than noting patient age (two older than 40 years), karyotype (two others associated with isochrome Xq), and associated cardiac risk factors (one with BAV). Studies have shown a possible genetic association of MMD linked to chromosome 17 in Japanese cases as well as in cases found in other demographics. The gene responsible for NF1 is located on the chromosome region 17q11.2 and for familial moyamoya disease on chromosome 17q25. Autosomal dominant moyamoya disease maps to chromosome 17q25.3.Under both classifications, significant evidence of linkage was only observed on chromosome 17q25.3, with maximum multipoint logarithm of odds (lod) scores of 6.57 (under the narrow classification) and 8.07 (under the broad classification) at D17S704. Haplotype analysis revealed segregation of a disease haplotype in all families but one, and informative crossovers enabled mapping of the MMD locus to a 3.5-Mb region between D17S1806 and the telomere of 17q, encompassing 94 annotated genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that there is a major gene locus for autosomal dominant moyamoya disease on chromosome 17q25.3.However, the mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosomal genotype showed that affected members had the same sequence of the Mitochondrial 3 portion of D-loop with Japanese patients.

She had been prenatally diagnosed with trisomy 12p with a familial pericentric inversion of chromosome 12 originating from her mother. She manifested developmental delay and some dysmorphic features of the face and limbs compatible with the clinical features of trisomy 12p.The genes encoding tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) 4 and TIMP2 span chromosomes 3p24.2-p26 and 17q25, respectively, which are the locations of familial moyamoya disease (FMMD) genes. We postulate that a protein encoded on chromosome 21 may be related to the pathogenesis of Down's syndrome with moyamoya syndrome.[Molecular screening for moyamoya disease by use of expressed sequence tag on chromosome 3p]. To identify the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with monoallelic expressions on chromosome 3, we used mouse A9 hybrid cells having human chromosome 3. Two ESTs showed only maternal expression in mouse A9 hybrid cells, and four showed non-expression in the lymphocytes derived from moyamoya patients. A novel susceptibility locus for moyamoya disease on chromosome 8q23.Previous linkage studies have indicated that susceptibility loci for the disease are located on chromosomes 3p, 6q, and 17q. In the present study, we searched for loci linked to the disease in 12 Japanese families using 428 microsatellite markers and found significant evidence for linkage to 8q23 [maximum LOD score (MLS) of 3.6] and suggestive evidence for linkage to 12p12 (MLS=2.3). Considering the function, we selected nine genes as candidates from a total of 65 genes identified in the 9-cM region of D17S785-D17S836 in chromosome 17q25, and performed sequence analysis on the DNA samples obtained from a pedigree of familial moyamoya disease, which showed a complete linkage to the region by a haplotype analysis. Linkage of familial moyamoya disease (spontaneous occlusion of the circle of Willis) to chromosome 17q25.The characteristic lesions of moyamoya disease are occasionally seen in neurofibromatosis type 1, of which the causative gene (NF1) has been assigned to chromosome 17q11.2.CONCLUSIONS: A gene for familial moyamoya disease is located on chromosome 17q25.Recent genetic studies suggest some responsible genetic foci in chromosomes 3, 6 and 17.To further specify the genetic component of moyamoya disease, a linkage study of moyamoya disease using markers on chromosome 6, where the HLA gene is located, was performed. Mapping of a familial moyamoya disease gene to chromosome 3p24.2-p26.A linkage was found between the disease and markers located at 3p24.2-26.We postulate that a protein encoded on chromosome 21 may be related to the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease.

We thus developed a new CRM identification method MOPAT (motif pair tree), which identifies CRMs through the identification of motif modules, groups of motifs co-occurring in multiple CRMs.We thus developed a new CRM identification method MOPAT (motif pair tree), which identifies CRMs through the identification of motif modules, groups of motifs co-occurring in multiple CRMs.\"}, {\"question\": \"Which diseases is microRNA 132 (miR-132) implicated in?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Several targets for for miR-132 have been described and it is implicated in many diseases such as:\\nneurodegenerative disease, \\nepilepsy,\\nschizophrenia,\\nHuntington's disease (HD),\\nAlzheimer's disease (AD),\\nneuroinflammation,\\nosteosarcoma,\\nchronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL),\\nangiogenesis,\\neye disease,\\nalcoholic liver disease,\\nprogressive supranuclear palsy (PSP taupathy),\\nmild cognitive impairment.\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"neurodegenerative disease\"], [\"epilepsy\"], [\"schizophrenia\"], [\"Huntington's disease (HD)\"], [\"Alzheimer's disease (AD)\"], [\"neuroinflammation\"], [\"osteosarcoma\"], [\"chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)\"], [\"angiogenesis\"], [\"eye disease\"], [\"alcoholic liver disease\"], [\"progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP taupathy)\"], [\"mild cognitive impairment\"]], \"context\": \"Levels of six candidate miRNAs (miR-21, miR-199a-3p, miR-143, miR-34, miR-140, and miR-132) that were previously demonstrated to be regulated in osteosarcoma were examined in plasma of 40 osteosarcoma patients and 40 matched healthy controls by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays.Functional studies employing antagomirs have identified contributions from miR-34a and miR-132 to seizure-induced neuronal death whereas silencing miR-134 potently reduced status epilepticus, seizure-damage and the later occurrence of spontaneous seizures. Efforts to identify the in vivo target(s) of epilepsy-regulated miRNAs, is now a priority. Last, miRNA are stable, information-carrying (paracrine) signals. Profiling miRNA in biofluids may represent a novel source of disease biomarkers in epilepsy.Inflammation, stress signalling and neuronal excitation are among the pathways most impacted.Herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes a chronic immuno-inflammatory response in the eye that may result in corneal neovascularization during blinding immunopathological lesion stromal keratitis (SK). miR-132 is a highly conserved miRNA that is induced in endothelial cells in response to growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).miR-132 expression was up-regulated (10- to 20-fold) after ocular infection with HSV, an event that involved the production of both VEGF-A and IL-17.The anti-angiogenic effect of antagomir-132 was reflected by a reduction in angiogenic Ras activity in corneal CD31-enriched cells (presumably blood vessel endothelial cells) during SK. To our knowledge, this is one of the first reports of miRNA involvement in an infectious ocular disease. Manipulating miRNA expression holds promise as a therapeutic approach to control an ocular lesion that is an important cause of human blindness.Role of miR-132 in angiogenesisThe cyclic AMP-responsive element binding- and NMDA-regulated microRNA miR-132 was significantly down-regulated in both the schizophrenic discovery cohort and a second, independent set of schizophrenic subjects. Analysis of miR-132 target gene expression in schizophrenia gene-expression microarrays identified 26 genes up-regulated in schizophrenia subjects.Our data suggest miR-132 dysregulation and subsequent abnormal expression of miR-132 target genes contribute to the neurodevelopmental and neuromorphological pathologies present in schizophrenia.Analysis of miRNA expression profiles from sporadic progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients, a major 4R-tau tauopathy, showed that miR-132 is specifically down-regulated in disease. We demonstrate that miR-132 directly targets the neuronal splicing factor polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2), which protein levels were increased in PSP patients. miR-132 overexpression or PTBP2 knockdown similarly affected endogenous 4R:3R-tau ratios in neuronal cells. Finally, we provide evidence that miR-132 is inversely correlated with PTBP2 during post-natal brain development at the time when 4R-tau becomes expressed. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in the miR-132/PTBP2 pathway could contribute to the abnormal splicing of tau exon 10 in the brain, and sheds light into the potential role played by miRNAs in a subset of tauopathies.Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by abnormal CAG expansion. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNA molecules regulating gene expression, and are implicated in a variety of diseases including HD.Nine miRNAs (miR-22, miR-29c, miR-128, miR-132, miR-138, miR-218, miR-222, miR-344, and miR-674*) were commonly down-regulated in both the 12-month-old YAC128 and 10-week-old R6/2 mice.Osteosarcoma is the first primary malignant bone tumor, characterized by a complex genetic and resistance to conventional treatments.Osteosarcoma of rat and human origins showed a miRNA signature, which could discriminate good from bad responders. In particular, we identified five discriminating miRNAs (miR-92a, miR-99b, miR-132, miR-193a-5p and miR-422a) in patient tumors, which could be easily transferable to diagnosis.Levels of several microRNA (miR-10a, -10b, -212, -132, -495) were significantly altered. One of them (miR-132) has been reported to be highly inducible by growth factors and to be a key regulator of neurite outgrowth. Moreover, miR-132-recognition sequences were detected in the mRNA transcripts of two differentially expressed proteins. MicroRNA may thus represent novel biomarkers for neuronal malfunction and potential therapeutic targets for human neurodegenerative diseases.The data indicate that micro-RNAs encoding miR-9, miR-124a, miR-125b, miR-128, miR-132 and miR-219 are abundantly represented in fetal hippocampus, are differentially regulated in aged brain, and an alteration in specific micro-RNA complexity occurs in Alzheimer hippocampus.

Immunogold labeling for GluR4 was confined to synaptic sites, represented by puncta in immunofluorescence. The relative numbers of puncta changed with a gradient similar to that of GLAST labeling. VGLUT1 labeling occurred in IHCs but showed no clear cochleotopic gradient. These data suggest that both the density of innervation and the activity levels of glutamatergic synapses may be involved in modulating regional expression of GLAST.In brain, EAAC1 (excitatory amino acid carrier 1) is the primary neuronal glutamate transporter, localized on the perisynaptic membranes that are near release sites.Reticulon RTN2B regulates trafficking and function of neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1.Previously, we identified an EAAC1-associated protein, GTRAP3-18, an ER protein that prevents ER exit of EAAC1 when inducedHere we show that RTN2B, a member of the reticulon protein family that mainly localizes in the ER and ER exit sites interacts with EAAC1 and GTRAP3-18In this study, uptake of L-[14C]cystine by three of the high affinity sodium-dependent mammalian glutamate transporters (GLT1, GLAST and EAAC1) individually expressed in HEK cells has been determinedReduction of L-[14C]cystine to L-[14C]cysteine in the presence of 1mM cysteinylglycine increases the uptake rate in HEK(GLT1), HEK(GLAST) and HEK(EAAC1) cells, but only a small proportion (<10%) of L-[14C]cysteine uptake in HEK(GLT1) and HEK(GLAST) cells occurs by the high affinity glutamate transportersPosition of the third Na+ site in the aspartate transporter GltPh and the human glutamate transporter, EAAT1.We studied the subunit stoichiometry of two distantly related glutamate transporters, the human glial glutamate transporter hEAAT2 and a bacterial glutamate transporter from Escherichia coli, ecgltP.Glutamate receptors and transporters, including T1R1 and T1R3 (taste receptor 1, subtypes 1 and 3), mGluRs (metabotropic glutamate receptors), EAAC-1 (excitatory amino acid carrier-1), GLAST-1 (glutamate-aspartate transporter-1), and GLT-1 (glutamate transporter-1), are expressed in the gastrointestinal tractThe ASCTs (alanine, serine, and cysteine transporters) belong to the solute carrier family 1 (SLC1), which also includes the human glutamate transporters (excitatory amino acid transporters, EAATs) and the prokaryotic aspartate transporter GltPhAs astrocytes protect neurons by taking up glutamate via plasma-membrane transporters, we also studied the effect of GRK2 on the localization of the GLutamate ASpartate Transporter (GLAST)GLT-1, Glutamate Transporter 1, same as excitatory amino acid transporter 2; Glu, glutamateMultiple Functions of Glutamate Uptake via Meningococcal GltT-GltM l-Glutamate ABC Transporter in Neisseria meningitidis Internalization into Human Brain Microvascular Endothelial CellsDespite the high degree of amino acid sequence identity between family members, ASCTs function quite differently from the EAATs and GltPh. First, Li(+) cannot support transport by EAAT2, whereas it can support transport by the other excitatory amino acid transporters, and second, EAAT2 is sensitive to a wider range of blockers than other subtypes. hGLT-1 and hGLuT-1 mRNAs were most abundantly expressed in the brain, while hEAAC1 mRNA expression (3.8 kb and 2,4 kb) was strongest in peripheral organs.

Subcutaneous in vivo implantation of auricular and nasal scaffolds resulted in an excellent appearance and complete soft tissue ingrowth.

Congenital cataracts-facial dysmorphism-neuropathy syndrome (CCFDN, MIM: 604168), is a recently delineated neurogenetic disease causing recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis; prevention and early diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis should be part of the clinical management of the disease.Congenital Cataracts Facial Dysmorphism Neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome is a complex developmental disorder of autosomal recessive inheritance. OBJECTIVE: To determine the nature and course of ophthalmologic abnormalities in congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome in a genetically verified group of 9 patients.Congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome (OMIM 604168) is an autosomal recessive developmental disorder that occurs in an endogamous group of Vlax Roma (Gypsies; refs. 1-3). The major differential diagnosis of MSS is the syndrome defined by congenital cataracts, facial dysmorphism and peripheral neuropathy (CCFDN), which is localised to 18qter.The CCFDN syndrome is a complex phenotype involving multiple systems, characterized by facial dysmorphism, congenital cataracts, microcorneae, delayed early motor and intellectual development, hypogonadotrop hypogonadism, hypomyelination of the peripheral nervous system, and serious complications related to general anaesthesia. Developmental abnormalities include congenital cataracts and microcorneae, primary hypomyelination of the peripheral nervous system, impaired physical growth, delayed early motor and intellectual development, mild facial dysmorphism and hypogonadism. Para-infectious rhabdomyolysis is a serious complication reported in an increasing number of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset congenital cataracts associated with microcornea, microphthalmos, and micropupil are essential ocular features of the CCFDN syndrome and are the first recognizable signs during early infancy. All patients showed a peripheral, demyelinating neuropathy and varying degrees of ataxia. In the older patients, muscular atrophy in distal muscles and facial dysmorphism was evident. Early-onset bilateral congenital cataracts associated with microcornea, microphthalmos, and micropupil could be found in all patients. All children had floppy eyelid syndrome and pseudoptosis.All patients had syndrome-associated nystagmus and congenital esotropia. Distant visual acuity could be classified as severe to moderate impairment, whereas near visual acuity was much better (mild to moderate impairment).Because these families originated from the same genetically isolated founder population as did patients with congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome, and because the two syndromes have clinical manifestations in common, we hypothesized that the two related, albeit distinct, syndromes may represent clinical variants of a single genetic disorder.

The disorder has been termed the congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome to emphasize its salient features. Associated neurological features are a moderate nonprogressive cognitive deficit in most affected individuals together with pyramidal signs and mild chorea in some. Accompanying nonneurological features include short stature, characteristic facial dysmorphism, and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism.

We also show that papilloma virus E7 abolishes the p38-induced growth arrest but not other senescence-associated phenotypes, indicating the differential role of pRb in the downstream of p38.Expression of caveolin-1 induces premature cellular senescence in primary cultures of murine fibroblastsHere, we demonstrate that mouse embryonic fibroblasts transgenically overexpressing caveolin-1 show: 1) a reduced proliferative lifespan; 2) senescence-like cell morphology; and 3) a senescence-associated increase in beta-galactosidase activity. These results indicate for the first time that the expression of caveolin-1 in vivo is sufficient to promote and maintain the senescent phenotype.Interestingly, premature senescence induced by hydrogen peroxide is greatly reduced in NIH 3T3 cells harboring antisense caveolin-1. Importantly, induction of premature senescence is recovered when caveolin-1 levels are restored.these results clearly indicate a central role for caveolin-1 in promoting cellular senescenceOncogenic activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade in murine fibroblasts initiates a senescence-like cell cycle arrest that depends on the ARF/p53 tumor suppressor pathway.In contrast, coexpression of oncogenic ras or activated mek1 with p53 enhanced both p53 levels and activity relative to that observed for p53 alone and produced an irreversible cell cycle arrest that displayed features of cellular senescence.our results indicate that oncogenic activation of the MAP kinase pathway in murine fibroblasts converts p53 into a senescence inducer through both quantitative and qualitative mechanisms.Myc-evoked apoptosis serves as a signal for macrophage attraction and activation, followed by the secretion of TGF-\\u03b2 as a cytokine that is capable of terminally arresting Myc-driven lymphoma cells without causing further DNA damage and without launching a senescence-associated, pro-inflammatory, and, therefore, potentially detrimental cytokine response in the target population.The suppression of oncogenic levels of MYC is sufficient to induce sustained tumor regression associated with proliferative arrest, differentiation, cellular senescence, and/or apoptosis, a phenomenon known as oncogene addiction.\"}, {\"question\": \"Which are the different proteins/isoforms encoded but the ASPH (aspartate beta-hydroxylase) gene in humans?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Alternative splicing of the locus AbetaH-J-J (asparetyl-beta-hydroxylase) generates three functionally distinct proteins: an enzyme, AbetaH (aspartyl-beta-hydroxylase), a structural protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane (junctin), and an integral membrane calcium binding protein (junctate).

One of the cDNAs is homologous to the previously reported human junctate.Screening a cDNA library from human skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle with a cDNA probe derived from junctin led to the isolation of two groups of cDNA clones. The first group displayed a deduced amino acid sequence that is 84% identical to that of dog heart junctin, whereas the second group had a single open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide with a predicted mass of 33 kDa, whose first 78 NH(2)-terminal residues are identical to junctin whereas its COOH terminus domain is identical to aspartyl beta-hydroxylase, a member of the alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family.

Furthermore, in two of these trials, alemtuzumab reduced the risk of accumulating disability compared with IFN\\u03b2-1a; indeed alemtuzumab treatment led to an improvement in disability and reduction in cerebral atrophy.Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for the CD52 protein present at high levels on the surface of B and T lymphocytes. In clinical trials, alemtuzumab has shown a clinical benefit superior to that of interferon-\\u03b2 in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients.These results potentially help explain the level of immunocompetence observed in alemtuzumab-treated MS patients.Alemtuzumab was first used in multiple sclerosis in 1991. It is a monoclonal antibody which is directed against CD52, a protein of unknown function on lymphocytes. Against an active comparator and the current first-line therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (interferon-beta), alemtuzumab showed a significant reduction in annualized relapse rate as well as a significant reduction in the accumulation of disability. Alemtuzumab (previously known as Campath(\\u00ae)) is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the CD52 antigen on mature lymphocytes that results in lymphopenia and subsequent modification of the immune repertoire. Compared to interferon beta-1a, alemtuzumab reduced the relapse rate by 49%-74% (P < 0.0001), and in two studies it reduced the risk of sustained disability accumulation by 42%-71% (P < 0.01). In one study (Comparison of Alemtuzumab and Rebif Efficacy in Multiple Sclerosis; CARE-MS1), there was no significant difference compared to interferon, perhaps reflecting the surprisingly low frequency of disability events in the comparator group.Alemtuzumab has been submitted for licensing in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in the United States and Europe.Alemtuzumab was associated with a greater chance of improved contrast sensitivity in patients with RRMS and may delay the worsening of visual function. The anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab reduced disease activity in a phase 2 trial of previously untreated patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Alemtuzumab's consistent safety profile and benefit in terms of reductions of relapse support its use for patients with previously untreated relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis; however, benefit in terms of disability endpoints noted in previous trials was not observed here. Alemtuzumab, formally known as Campath-1H, is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD52, a protein on the surface of lymphocytes and monocytes with unknown function. A single dose of alemtuzumab leads to a rapid, profound and prolonged lymphopenia. A Phase II trial has shown that alemtuzumab reduces the risk of relapse and accumulation of disability by over 70% compared with interferon beta in patients with early relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS).Alemtuzumab, targeting CD52 expressed on T-cells, B-cells, monocytes and macrophages, has also shown to be effective in early RRMS and phase III trials are currently ongoing. monoclonal antibody therapy has provided the opportunity to rationally direct the therapeutic intervention by specifically targeting mechanisms of the immune system such as CD52 (alemtuzumab), CD25 (daclizumab), VLA-4 (natalizumab) and CD20 (rituximab)Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD52, a broadly expressed cell surface molecule on immune cells.Alemtuzumab-treatment of MS patients with relapsing-remitting forms of the disease significantly reduced the risk of relapse and accumulation of disability compared to interferon \\u03b2-1a treatment in a phase II trial. Alemtuzumab (CD52-specific humanized monoclonal antibody) was found to be an effective therapy for treatment-naive patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Alemtuzumab effectively reduced relapse rates and improved clinical scores in patients with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis not controlled by interferon therapy.Alemtuzumab is an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody with remarkable efficacy in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). The anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab reduces disease activity in previously untreated patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. For patients with first-line treatment-refractory relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, alemtuzumab could be used to reduce relapse rates and sustained accumulation of disability. Campath-1H causes the immune response to change from the Th1 phenotype, suppressing multiple sclerosis disease activity, but permitting the generation of antibody-mediated thyroid autoimmunity.Campath-1H is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed at CD52 expressed on lymphocytes and other cells of the immune system. It has been tested extensively in lymphoid malignancies, autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and organ transplantation.Campath 1-H (Alemtuzumab) is a humanised monoclonal antibody which targets the CD52 antigen, a low molecular weight glycoprotein present on the surface of most lymphocyte lineages, causing complement mediated lysis and rapid and prolonged T lymphocyte depletion. Following encouraging initial data from other centres we report our open label experience of using Campath 1-H as a treatment in aggressive relapsing multiple sclerosis in a consecutive series of 39 highly selected patients treated across three regional centres and followed for a mean of 1.89 years.Alemtuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets CD52 on lymphocytes and monocytes, may be an effective treatment for early multiple sclerosis. In patients with early, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, alemtuzumab was more effective than interferon beta-1a but was associated with autoimmunity, most seriously manifesting as immune thrombocytopenic purpura.Alemtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD52, is a highly promising agent currently being studied in two phase III clinical trials. In this review, data from the recently published phase II clinical trial in the treatment of early relapsing remitting MS is summarized and analyzed in light of the development of alemtuzumab for MS and its potential role in treating this disease is discussed.Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against CD52, an antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant lymphocytes. It is approved for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and is undergoing Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. To assess the effect of systemic lymphocyte depletion on disease activity, seven patients with MS received a 10-day intravenous course of the humanised monoclonal antibody CAMPATH-1H (anti-CDw52).The effect of CAMPATH-1H on disease activity provides direct, but preliminary, evidence that disease activity in MS depends on the availability of circulating lymphocytes and can be prevented by lymphocyte depletion.The elective treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis, using a humanized anti-leukocyte (CD52) monoclonal antibody (Campath-1H), has illuminated mechanisms that underlie the clinical course of the disease. Alemtuzumab is currently under review to treat relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, based on positive Phase II and Phase III trials in both treatment-na\\u00efve and treated relapsing MS patients. Alemtuzumab has recently been approved by the European authorities for active relapsing MS, in essence as a first-line agent.Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD52. \"}, {\"question\": \"Which brain structures have been investigated as potential targets for deep brain stimulation of patients suffering from major depression?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Subgenual cingulate gyrus, the anterior limb of the capsula interna, nucleus accumbens, medial forebrain bundle, habenula, and caudate nucleus have been investigated as potential targeted for the deep brain stimulation of patients suffering from major depression.\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"subgenual cingulate gyrus\"], [\"anterior limb of the capsula interna\"], [\"nucleus accumbens\"], [\"medial forebrain bundle\"], [\"habenula\"], [\"ventral caudate nucleus\"]], \"context\": \"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is under scientific evaluation as a new treatment option for these treatment-resistant patients. First clinical studies with small samples have been stimulated at the subgenual cingulate gyrus (Cg25/24), the anterior limb of the capsula interna (ALIC), and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). New hypothesis-guided targets (e.g., medial forebrain bundle, habenula) are about to be assessed in clinical trials. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc-DBS) has antidepressant effects in patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The ventral striatum, including the head of the caudate nucleus and the nucleus accumbens, is a putative target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and major depression (MD). High frequency stimulation was successfully applied in several small samples of patients with treatment-resistant depression when the stimulation focused on different areas, e.g., nucleus accumbens, the lateral habenula or cortical areas.We recorded electrophysiological activity directly from the nucleus accumbens of five patients undergoing deep brain stimulation for treatment of refractory major depression. Functional inhibition of the lateral habenula via deep brain stimulation (DBS) has antidepressive properties.Because a prominent clinical feature of depression is anhedonia--the inability to experience pleasure from previously pleasurable activities--and because there is clear evidence of dysfunctions of the reward system in depression, DBS to the nucleus accumbens might offer a new possibility to target depressive symptomatology in otherwise treatment-resistant depression.These preliminary findings suggest that DBS to the nucleus accumbens might be a hypothesis-guided approach for refractory major depression.Deep brain stimulation of the ventral caudate nucleus markedly improved symptoms of depression and anxiety until their remission, which was achieved at 6 months after the start of stimulation (HDRS < or = 7 and HARS < or = 10).No neuropsychological deterioration was observed, indicating that DBS of the ventral caudate nucleus could be a promising strategy in the treatment of refractory cases of both OCD and major depression.Comparisons of clinical outcomes and anatomical data on electrode positioning showed that caudate nucleus stimulation preferentially alleviated OCD manifestations, whereas nucleus accumbens stimulation improved depressive symptoms. \"}, {\"question\": \"Which deiodinase polymorphisms are implicated in arterial hypertension?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Two deiodinase polymorphisms are implicated in arterial hypertension: Ala92 type 2 deiodinase allele and rs7140952 polymorphism of DIO2\", \"At least two deiodinease polymorfisms are  implicated in arterial hypertension:\\nDIO 2 Thr92Ala\\nrs7140952\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"rs7140952 polymorphism of DIO2\", \"rs7140952\"], [\"Ala92 type 2 deiodinase allele\", \"DIO 2 Thr92Ala\"]], \"context\": \"However, rs7140952 polymorphism is associated with components of metabolic syndrome including blood pressure and central obesity.Among euthyroid adults, the common Ala92 allele of the type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase increases risk for the development of hypertension.

We showed that Snail interacted with Suv39H1 and recruited it to the E-cadherin promoter for transcriptional repression.Knockdown of Suv39H1 restored E-cadherin expression by blocking H3K9me3 and DNA methylation and resulted in the inhibition of cell migration, invasion and metastasis of BLBC.9a interacts with Snail and is critical for Snail-mediated E-cadherin repression in human breast cancerHere, we have determined that methylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me2) is critical for promoter DNA methylation of E-cadherin in three TGF-\\u03b2-induced EMT model cell lines, as well as in CLBC cell lines.Further, Snail interacted with G9a, a major euchromatin methyltransferase responsible for H3K9me2, and recruited G9a and DNA methyltransferases to the E-cadherin promoter for DNA methylation.Knockdown of G9a restored E-cadherin expression by suppressing H3K9me2 and blocking DNA methylation. This resulted in inhibition of cell migration and invasion in vitro and suppression of tumor growth and lung colonization in in vivo models of CLBC metastasis.ZEB1, which targets E-cadherin repression, is a transcriptional regulator that has been implicated in EMT, and is associated with uterine and colorectal cancers.The introduction or knockdown of ZEB1 expression in bladder carcinoma cell lines showed enhanced or reduced migration and invasive potential, respectively.However, in vitro assays showed enhanced or reduced migration and invasion after the introduction or reduction of ZEB1, respectively, in transfected bladder cell lines.Finally, we showed aberrant IL-6 production and STAT3 activation in MCF-7 cells that constitutively express Twist, a metastatic regulator and direct transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin. To our knowledge, this is the first study that shows IL-6 as an inducer of an EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells and implicates its potential to promote breast cancer metastasis.unctional loss of the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin is an essential event for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that allows cell migration during embryonic development and tumour invasion. In most carcinomas, transcriptional repression has emerged as the main mechanism responsible for E-cadherin downregulation.Here, we report the identification of class I bHLH factor E2-2 (TCF4/ITF2) as a new EMT regulator.E-cadherin repression mediated by E2-2 is indirect and independent of proximal E-boxes of the promoter.Knockdown studies indicate that E2-2 expression is dispensable for maintenance of the EMT driven by Snail1 and E47.Slug mRNA was shown to be over-expressed in adenocarcinoma and inversely correlated to E-cadherin expression.Overexpression of Slug in OE33 mediated E-cadherin repression and induced the mesenchymal markers vimentin and fibronectin.SIP1 and deltaEF1 each dramatically down-regulated the transcription of E-cadherin in NMuMG cells through direct binding to the E-cadherin promoter.Silencing of the expression of both SIP1 and deltaEF1, but not either alone, completely abolished TGF-beta-induced E-cadherin repression.eltaEF1 is a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin and regulates epithelial plasticity in breast cancer cellsownregulation of E-cadherin is a crucial event for epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in embryonic development and cancer progression.Using the EpFosER mammary tumour model we show that during EMT, upregulation of the transcriptional regulator deltaEF1 coincided with transcriptional repression of E-cadherin.Ectopic expression of deltaEF1 in epithelial cells was sufficient to downregulate E-cadherin and to induce EMT.Analysis of E-cadherin promoter activity and chromatin immunoprecipitation identified deltaEF1 as direct transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin.In human cancer cells, transcript levels of deltaEF1 correlated directly with the extent of E-cadherin repression and loss of the epithelial phenotype.RNA interference-mediated downregulation of deltaEF1 in cancer cells was sufficient to derepress E-cadherin expression and restore cell to cell adhesion, suggesting that deltaEF1 is a key player in late stage carcinogenesis.TGF-beta-induced the expression of Ets1, which in turn activated deltaEF1 promoter activity. Moreover, up-regulation of SIP1 and deltaEF1 expression by TGF-beta was suppressed by knockdown of Ets1 expression.

It is approved by the FDA for the treatment of depression. Insomnia is the most frequent reason for prescription of trazodone. It has also been proven useful in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Other off-label uses include the treatment of bulimia, benzodiazepine/alcohol dependence, fibromyalgia, central nervous system degenerative diseases (behavioral disorders in dementia and other organic disorders), schizophrenia, chronic pain disease and diabetic neuropathy, sexual dysfunction.symptoms of vasomotor dysregulation (hot flashes) associated with the menopausal transition and sex hormone deprivation. Implication of changes in central neurotransmission in the pathogenesis of hot flashes has prompted the off-label use of serotonergic and \\u03b3-aminobutyric acid-ergic drugs as a therapeutic alternative,Sertraline was the most prescribed antidepressant for the treatment of major depressive disorder, followed by fluvoxamine and tianeptine. Fluvoxamine was the most prescribed antidepressant for the treatment of anxiety disorders and mixed disorders of emotions and conduct. Off-label prescribing of antidepressants was found in 85.6% of young patients.Our results suggest that duloxetine is a possible alternative treatment of postprostatectomy established stress urinary incontinence.Pharmacological treatment of fibromyalgia.different classes of drugs with different mechanisms of action are used off-label, including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)Gynaecological cancer patients generally suffer from an earlier and more severe menopausal syndrome than the general female population. Hormone replacement therapy is often contraindicated and there are non-hormonal treatments that are proven to be more effective than placebo in randomized controlled trials, e.g., some antidepressants, gabapentine and clonidine. The main limits to the use of these drugs in controlling hot flashes are the off-label use for this purpose,ymptomatic therapy for patients with erectile dysfunction.a oral daily off label use therapy with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline) can be offered.Without the Food and Drug Administration approval, dapoxetine, as well as other SSRIs in PE, is an off-label drug for PE.the treatment of PE consists of primarily off-label use of oral selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) via either on-demand or daily delivery. The results of this off-label use show that Duloxetine is effective in men with SUI after prostate surgery even if standard pelvic floor exercises have failed.Preliminary results on the off-label use of duloxetine for the treatment of stress incontinence after radical prostatectomy or cystectomy.the number of children and adolescents whose visits involved prescription of antidepressants, particularly SSRIs, has increased markedly through 2002. Although fluoxetine remained the most commonly prescribed, other SSRIs were increasingly prescribed through 2002. These trends raise concerns regarding the widespread off-label use of antidepressants lacking reliable evidence of safety and efficacy for use in children and adolescents.Given the presumed efficacy of these new compounds and the off-label use of the current SSRIs, one might conclude that psychotherapy\\\\behavior therapy for rapid ejaculation is an obsolete and antiquated interventionThe use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy and breast-feeding:The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy or lactation is, to date, not promoted because of lack of safety documentation. However, the off-label use of these drugs has been common for several years. In the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders during pregnancy, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors are often preferred over tricyclic antidepressants because of their relatively few adverse effects and safety in overdose. The last few years have seen a remarkable rise in the off-label use of trazodone for inducing sleep in nondepressed patients, to a degree that it is prescribed for this purpose as commonly as the leading hypnoticSince the mid-1980s there has been a rapid rise in the off-label use of antidepressants, particularly trazodone, for treating insomnia.\"}, {\"question\": \"List receptors of the drug Cilengitide\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Cilengitide binds \\u03b1v\\u03b23 and \\u03b1v\\u03b25 integrins.

Gene knockdown experiments indicated that these effects of cilengitide were, at least partly, due to antagonism of \\u03b1v\\u03b23 and \\u03b1v\\u03b25.Abstract The RGD cyclic pentapetide, cilengitide, is a selective inhibitor of \\u03b1v\\u03b23 and \\u03b1v\\u03b25 integrins and was developed for antiangiogenic therapy. Cilengitide is an RGD-peptide of sequence cyclo[RGDfNMeV] that was was developed as a highly active and selective ligand for the \\u03b1v\\u03b23 and \\u03b1v\\u03b25 integrin receptors.RESULTS: \\u03b1v\\u03b25 was the predominantly expressed integrin heterodimer in meningiomas, whereas \\u03b1v\\u03b23 was mainly detected in tumor blood vessels. Application of up to 100 \\u03bcg/mL cilengitide resulted in only mildly reduced proliferation/survival of meningioma cell lines. UW479 cells expressed only \\u03b1v\\u03b25 integrin and were not sensitive to cilengitide, suggesting that cilengitide's action largely depends on \\u03b1v\\u03b23 inhibition.Cilengitide's action on glioma and neuroblastoma cells appears to be dependent on \\u03b1v\\u03b23 expression and sensitivity to anoikis. METHODS: For this purpose, nude rats bearing bone metastases were treated with cilengitide, a small molecule inhibitor of \\u03b1v\\u03b23 and \\u03b1v\\u03b25 integrins, from day 30 to 55 after tumor cell inoculation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (25 mg/kg, 5 days per week; n = 8 rats) and compared to control rats (n = 8). The \\u03b1V\\u03b23/\\u03b1V\\u03b25 integrin inhibitor cilengitide augments tumor response to melphalan isolated limb perfusion in a sarcoma model.Cilengitide, a cyclized Arg-Gly-Glu(RGD)-containing pentapeptide that selectively blocks activation of the \\u03b1v\\u03b23 and \\u03b1v\\u03b25 integrins has shown encouraging activity in patients with glioblastoma as single agent, and in association with standard RT and temozolomide.  Aza-amino acid scanning was performed on the cyclic RGD-peptide Cilengitide, cyclo[R-G-D-f-N(Me)V] 1, and its parent peptide cyclo(R-G-D-f-V) 2, potent antagonists of the \\u03b1v\\u03b23, \\u03b1v\\u03b25, and \\u03b15\\u03b21 integrin receptors, which play important roles in human tumor metastasis and tumor-induced angiogenesis. Cilengitide (EMD121974; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) is a new drug targeting \\u03b1v\\u03b23 and \\u03b1v\\u03b25 integrins thanks to a specific peptide called RGD sequence. Cilengitide, a cyclic RGD-mimetic peptide of \\u03b1v\\u03b23 and \\u03b1v\\u03b25 integrins is in advanced clinical development in glioblastoma.The purpose of this study was the assessment of the feasibility of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) to quantify effects of the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide cilengitide, which targets the \\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03b2 3 and \\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03b2 5 integrin receptors in rats with breast cancer bone metastases. We conducted a phase II study of cilengitide, a selective antagonist of \\u03b1(v)\\u03b2(3) and \\u03b1(v)\\u03b2(5) integrins, in non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer with rising PSA. AlphaVbeta3 and alphaVbeta5 integrins are overexpressed on both glioma cells and tumor vasculature. Cilengitide, the most advanced specific integrin inhibitor in oncology, has shown antitumor activity against glioma in early clinical trials. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of inhibiting \\u03b1v\\u03b2(3)/\\u03b1(v) \\u03b2(5) integrins by cilengitide in experimentally induced breast cancer bone metastases using noninvasive imaging techniques. For this purpose, nude rats bearing established breast cancer bone metastases were treated with cilengitide, a small molecule inhibitor of \\u03b1v\\u03b2(3) and \\u03b1v\\u03b2(5) integrins (75 mg/kg, five days per week; n = 12 rats) and compared to vehicle-treated control rats (n = 12).  In conclusion, treatment of experimental breast cancer bone metastases with cilengitide resulted in pronounced antiresorptive and antitumor effects, suggesting that \\u03b1v\\u03b2(3)/\\u03b1v\\u03b2(5) inhibition may be a promising therapeutic approach for bone metastases.Integrin antagonists, including the alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 inhibitor cilengitide, have shown encouraging activity in Phase II clinical trials and cilengitide is currently being tested in a Phase III trial in patients with glioblastoma. Cilengitide (cyclic peptidic alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 antagonist) is currently in clinical trials for anti cancer therapy.PURPOSE: Cilengitide, an inhibitor of alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrin receptors, demonstrated minimal toxicity and durable activity across a wide range of doses administered to adults with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in a prior phase I study. In line with this concept, peptide ligands containing the Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate (RGD) triad, which display a strong affinity and selectivity to the alpha(V)beta(3) integrin, have been developed to target the tumor-associated cells expressing the alpha (V)beta (3) receptors. Among the validated ligands, the leader compound is the cyclic pentapeptide c[-RGDf(NMe)V-] (Cilengitide) developed by kessler et al. (J. Med. Chem., 1999, 42, 3033-3040). Assessment of the biological and pharmacological effects of the alpha nu beta3 and alpha nu beta5 integrin receptor antagonist, cilengitide (EMD 121974), in patients with advanced solid tumors.BACKGROUND: Cilengitide, an antiangiogenic agent that inhibits the binding of integrins alpha(nu)beta(3) and alpha(nu)beta(5) to the extracellular matrix, was studied at two dose levels in cancer patients to determine the optimal biological dose. Cilengitide (EMD121974; NSC 707544), is a potent selective alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrin antagonist. Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of continuous twice weekly intravenous administration of Cilengitide (EMD 121974), a novel inhibitor of the integrins alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 in patients with advanced solid tumours.A single-agent dose escalating phase I and pharmacokinetic study with Cilengitide, an inhibitor of the integrins alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5, was performed to determine its safety and toxicity. This study was designed to determine whether, and how, the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide Cilengitide (EMD 121974), which targets the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin receptor expressed on neovasculature, could increase systemic RIT efficacy of therapy in a human breast cancer tumor model having mutant p53 and expressing bcl-2. The purpose of this study was the assessment of the feasibility of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) to quantify effects of the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide cilengitide, which targets the \\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03b2 3 and \\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03b2 5 integrin receptors in rats with breast cancer bone metastases\"}, {\"question\": \"Which genes are more frequently affected by somatic mutations in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"TP53, ATM, NOTCH1, XPO1, MYD88, KLHL6, SF3B1, ZMYM3, MAPK1, FBXW7 and DDX3X\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"TP53\"], [\"ATM\"], [\"NOTCH1\"], [\"XPO1\"], [\"MYD88\"], [\"KLHL6\"], [\"SF3B1\"], [\"ZMYM3\"], [\"MAPK1\"], [\"FBXW7\"], [\"DDX3X\"]], \"context\": \"Among these genes, SF3B1, encoding a subunit of the spliceosomal U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), is somatically mutated in 9.7% of affected individuals.Further analysis of these mutations in 363 patients with CLL identified four genes that are recurrently mutated: notch 1 (NOTCH1), exportin 1 (XPO1), myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88) and kelch-like 6 (KLHL6).Nine genes that are mutated at significant frequencies were identified, including four with established roles in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (TP53 in 15% of patients, ATM in 9%, MYD88 in 10%, and NOTCH1 in 4%) and five with unestablished roles (SF3B1, ZMYM3, MAPK1, FBXW7, and DDX3X).

It also contributes indirectly to the global repair of some forms of oxidative DNA damage. The Escherichia coli homolog, Mfd, is similarly required for TCR of UV-induced lesions.Transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) is involved in correcting UV-induced damage and other road-blocks encountered in the transcribed strand.

oxidative DNA damage that is efficiently bypassed by RNA polymerase, is subject to Mfd-dependent transcription-coupled repair in Escherichia coli.The transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF, the

1 is the most common type of inherited LQTS and is linked to mutations in the KCNQ1 gene. This report describes a three-generation family with a severe phenotype of long-QT syndrome-1 (LQTS-1) caused by a single nucleotide mutation in the KQT-like, voltage-gated potassium channel-1 gene (KCNQ1; MIM 607542).Mutations in a cardiac voltage-gated potassium channel, KCNQ1, account for the most common form of LQTS, LQTS1. Nine patients were diagnosed with LQT1 and nine with LQT2. The other six individuals were healthy, with no symptoms characteristic for prolonged QT syndrome, but came from families with confirmed disease occurrence. The study was conducted on members of four families. In order to search for mutations (using mSSCP and sequencing), genomic DNA was obtained from patients to determine the expression levels of the genes KCNQ1 and KCNH2 (HERG), involved in the occurrence of clinical signs of disease.Diagnosis of RWS is established by prolongation of the QTc interval in the absence of specific conditions known to lengthen it (for example, QT-prolonging drugs) and/or molecular genetic testing of the genes known to be associated with RWS, of which KCNQ1 (locus name LQT1), KCNH2 (locus name LQT2) and SCN5A (locus name LQT3) are the most common. Other, less frequently involved genes are KCNE1 (locus name LQT5), KCNE2 (locus name LQT6), CAV3 (locus name LQT9), SCN4B (locus name LQT10), AKAP9 (locus name LQT11), SNTA1 (locus name LQT12) and KCNJ5 (locus name LQT13).Type-1 long-QT syndrome (LQT1) is caused by mutations in the KCNQ1 gene.Congenital LQTS is most frequently caused by mutations in KCNQ1 (Kv7.1), whereas drug-induced LQTS is a consequence of HERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) channel inhibition. Mutations in the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit KCNQ1 induce the most common form of LQTS.Genetic studies have identified mutations in six ion channel genes, KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1 and KCNE2 and the accessory protein Ankyrin-B gene, to be responsible for this disorder. Seven family members were carriers of two amino acid alterations in cis (V254M-V417M) in the cardiac potassium channel gene KCNQ1. KCNQ1 (formerly called KVLQT1) is a Shaker-like voltage-gated potassium channel gene responsible for the LQT1 sub-type of LQTS.Five genes have been implicated in Romano-Ward syndrome, the autosomal dominant form of LQTS: KVLQT1, HERG, SCN5A, KCNE1, and KCNE2.It usually is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait (Romano-Ward syndrome). The primary defect in LQT1 is a mutation in KVLQT1, a gene that encodes the pore-forming alpha-subunit of a K+ channel. Romano-Ward syndrome is an autosomal dominant long-QT syndrome (LQTS) that predisposes affected individuals to sudden death from tachyarrhythmias. We investigated the molecular basis of LQTS in a Taiwanese kindred. Clinical and genetic analyses revealed that a mutation was linked to the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG).We describe a Swedish family with the proband and his brother suffering from severe Romano-Ward syndome (RWS) associated with compound heterozygosity for two mutations in the KVLQT1 (also known as KCNQ1 and KCNA9)The cardiac sodium channel gene, SCN5A, is also mutated in some Romano-Ward cases to produce defects in INa, the cardiac inward Na+ current. These findings provide the first evidence for a recessive form of the Romano-Ward long-QT syndrome and indicate that homozygous mutations on KVLQT1 do not invariably produce the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. \"}, {\"question\": \"What are the major clinical Villefranche criteria for classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"The major clinical Villefranche criteria for classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are skin hyperextensibility, dystrophic scarring, and joint hypermobility.\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"skin hyperextensibility\"], [\"dystrophic scarring\"], [\"joint hypermobility\"]], \"context\": \"All type V collagen defects were identified within a group of 102 patients fulfilling all major clinical Villefranche criteria, that is, skin hyperextensibility, dystrophic scarring and joint hypermobilityAll type V collagen defects were identified within a group of 102 patients fulfilling all major clinical Villefranche criteria, that is, skin hyperextensibility, dystrophic scarring and joint hypermobility\"}, {\"question\": \"What is the treatment of neuropathic pain in children?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"It is unclear if any treatment is registered for pediatric use.

CONCLUSIONS: Vulvodynia does occur among young girls and, when treated as a neuropathic pain disorder, was found to dramatically improve or remit in the majority of those treated in this small case series.We describe a case series of five adolescents who were managed with lidocaine 5% patches for chronic localized neuropathic pain from a variety of causes with minimal adverse effects. Treatment was effective in four of five patients with only one patient complaining of minimal pain reliefTwenty-two children or 14% of children on opioid therapy underwent 30 opioid rotations. Mucositis was the cause of pain in 19 (70%) children, bone pain in 3 (11%) children, and postoperative, visceral, or neuropathic pain in the remainder. The opioid was rotated either for excessive side effects with adequate analgesia (70%), excessive side effects with inadequate analgesia (16.7%), or tolerance (6.7%). Five (23%) children required two rotations, 3 during the same admission. The favored rotations were morphine to fentanyl in 20 (67%) children and fentanyl to hydromorphone in 6 (20%). Adverse opioid effects were resolved in 90% of cases, all failures occurred when morphine was rotated to fentanyl.To test the hypothesis that children with terminal cancer and neuropathic pain require rapid increases of opioids and benzodiazepines immediately before death, we compared drug usage in the last 72 hours of life in children with and without neuropathic painDying children with cancer and neuropathic pain have higher baseline requirements of morphine and benzodiazepines and require rapid increases of both drugs in the last 72 hours of life than dying children without neuropathic pain.ketamine treatment may be effective in children with severe neuropathic pain not responsive to other analgesics. This patient also demonstrates the feasibility of long-term ketamine treatment in pediatric oncology and that such treatment can be administered in a home care setting.Oral amitriptyline has been used as an analgesic in a wide range of pain settings. Despite long-term availability of a parenteral form, the few reports about this formulation have been limited to pharmacokinetic studies in normal volunteers, trials in depressed patients, and analyses of electroencephalogram (EEG) activation. We retrospectively reviewed our experience using intravenous (IV) amitriptyline at Children's Hospital, Boston and at Children's Hospital at Stanford.

Novel associations with some clinical outcomes were found with single nucleotide polymorphisms in the cytochrome 450 genes CYP2C18 and CYP2C19, which were independent of the associations observed with CYP2C9 and in genes encoding CYP3A5, protein S and clotting factor V, although the variability explained by these genes was small.VKORC1 -1639 G>A polymorphism, body weight, age, and serum albumin were found to affect the inter-individual variabilitthe CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes have been demonstrated to be determinants of warfarin response.On the basis of these observations, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a labeling change for warfarin that includes the genetic information of VKORC1 and CYP2C9 as factors influencing interindividual variability in warfarin dosing.

In particular, the discovery of polymorphisms in the VKORC1 gene that strongly impact oral anticoagulant dose has heightened expectations that genetic testingOur data suggest that CYP2C9 genotype, age and body size are important determinants of warfarin dose requirements in African-Americans. Our data further suggest that the VKORC1 G6853C polymorphism alone may not be useful for predicting warfarin dose requirements in this racial group.A strong association was found between genetic polymorphisms in six genes, including VKORC1, CYP2C9, PROC, EPHX1, GGCX, and ORM1, and interindividual variability in the anticoagulant effect of warfarin; the strongest predictors were VKORC1 and CYP2C9.Three of six VKORC1 SNPs were found to be very strongly associated with the average warfarin dose required to achieve the target international normalised ratio (INR; p<0.0001)These results are of considerable clinical interest and confirm recently published results regarding the role of these two genes in modifying warfarin metabolism and maintenance dosage. The consistent findings regarding the role of VKORC1 and CYP2C9 in warfarin metabolism and maintenance dosage represent a clinically useful proof of principal for the use of pharmacogenomic information in medicine and may lead to improved understanding of warfarin's actions.Clinical studies showed an increased plasma level of S-warfarin, decreased clearance of S-warfarin, increased frequency of bleeding, and prolongation of hospitalization in patients with variant CYP2C9 alleles.\"}, {\"question\": \"List sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors that have been FDA approved for type 2 diabetes mellitus treatment.\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Canagliflozin, along with dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, are SGLT2 inhibitors approved by the US FDA for use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"Dapagliflozin\"], [\"Empagliflozin\"], [\"Canagliflozin\"]], \"context\": \"Canagliflozin was the first SGLT2 inhibitor to be approved by the US FDA for use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and recently dapagliflozin has also been approved.To review available studies of empagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor approved in 2014 by the European Commission and the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Nuclear N(ICD) forms a transcriptional activation complex by interacting with the coactivator protein Mastermind-like 1 and the DNA binding protein CSL (for CBF-1/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag-1) to regulate target gene expression.Although it is well understood that N(ICD) forms a transcriptional activation complex, little is known about how the complex is assembled.Canonical Notch signaling is initiated when ligand binding induces proteolytic release of the intracellular part of Notch (ICN) from the cell membrane.

This review describes current pharmacophore modelling methods applied in the discovery of novel inhibitors targeting protein-protein interactions. We first address the mimicry of protein-protein interactions with their respective inhibitors as observed in crystal structure complexes. This mimicry can be exploited to derive a pharmacophore query from protein-protein complex structures. We then discuss several cases where pharmacophore queries were utilized for the discovery of first-in-class inhibitors of their respective protein-protein interaction targets.The best HypoGen pharmacophore model for ACC2 inhibitors (Hypo1_ACC2) consists of one hydrogen bond acceptor, one hydrophobic aliphatic and one hydrophobic aromatic feature, whereas the best pharmacophore (Hypo1_ACC1) for ACC1 consists of one additional hydrogen-bond donor (HBD) features. The best pharmacophore hypotheses were validated by various methods such as test set, decoy set and Cat-Scramble methodology. The validated pharmacophore models were used to screen several small-molecule databases, including Specs, NCI, ChemDiv and Natural product databases to identify the potential dual ACC inhibitors. The virtual hits were then subjected to several filters such as estimated [Formula: see text] value, quantitative estimation of drug-likeness and molecular docking analysis.pharmacophore model has been developed using diverse classes of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors useful in the treatment of human tumours.

The model also maps well to the external test set molecules as well as clinically active molecules and corroborates the docking studies. Finally, 10 hits were identified as potential leads after virtual screening of ZINC database for EGFR TK inhibition. In order to clarify the essential structure-activity relationship for the known Aurora-A inhibitors as well as identify new lead compounds against Aurora-A, 3D pharmacophore models were developed based on the known inhibitors. computational methods for molecular design are well established in medicinal chemistry research, their application in the field of natural products is still not exhaustively explored.

The challenge is which selection criteria and/or multiple filtering tools to apply for a target-oriented isolation of potentially bioactive secondary metabolites. Application examples are provided where in silico tools and classical methods used by natural product scientists are used in an effort to maximize their efficacy in drug discovery. pharmacophore models derived from protein binding site atoms without the inclusion of any ligand information have become more popular in virtual screening studies. However, the accuracy of protein-based pharmacophore models for reproducing the critical protein-ligand interactions has never been explicitly assessed. Our results demonstrate that there are significant variations in the success of protein-based pharmacophore models to reproduce native contacts and consequently native ligand poses dependent on the details of the pharmacophore generation process. We show that the generation of optimized protein-based pharmacophore models is a promising approach for ligand pose prediction and pose rankingspharmacophore model does not describe a real molecule or a real association of functional groups but illustrates a molecular recognition of a biological target shared by a group of compounds. Pharmacophores also represent the spatial arrangement of essential interactions in a receptor-binding pocket. Structure based pharmacophores (SBPs) can work both with a free (apo) structure or a macromolecule-ligand complex (holo) structure. The SBP methods that derive pharmacophore from protein-ligand complexes use the potential interactions observed between ligand and protein, whereas, the SBP method that aims to derive pharmacophore from ligand free protein, uses only protein active site information3D pharmacophore methods are now commonly used as part of more complex workflows in drug discovery campaigns, and have been successfully and extensively applied in virtual screening (VS) approaches. \"}, {\"question\": \"Which are the inhibitors of histone methyltransferases?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"In general, histone methyltransferases (HMTs) have no widely approved high-throughput screening assay format, and therefore reference inhibitors are not available for many of the HMTs.

It was suggested that defects in CASQ2 cause protein deficiency and impair Ca(2+) uptake to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition of ryanodine channels, leading to diastolic Ca(2+) leak, after-depolarizations, and arrhythmia. The autosomal recessive form of CPVT is caused by mutations in the CASQ2 gene. In a consanguineous family, a novel homozygous CASQ2 mutation (p.L77P) was identified in a child with CPVT who required implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator due to episodes of syncope while on medical therapy. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a familial cardiac arrhythmia that is related to RYR2 or CASQ2 gene mutation.Thirteen mutations in the CASQ2 gene have been reported so far in association with CPVT. These data increased significantly the number of CASQ2 mutations described in association with CPVT, revealed the high prevalence of splicing and truncating mutations in this gene and brought new insight regarding the dominant inheritance of the disease. Moreover, our report of the first splicing abnormalities in CASQ2 caused by intronic mutation or synonymous change underlines the absolute necessity to perform extensive molecular analysis for genetic diagnosis and counseling of CPVT.Mutations in the human cardiac calsequestrin gene (CASQ2) are linked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT-2).Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial cardiac arrhythmia that is related to RYR2 or CASQ2 gene mutation. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an uncommon heritable disease presenting with syncope or sudden cardiac death. Two genes involved in calcium homeostasis, the ryanodine receptor gene and the calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) gene, have been implicated in this disease. We describe a young man presenting with exercise-induced syncope, clinically diagnosed as CPVT. Genetic analysis revealed two mutations, p.Y55C (c.164A>G) and p.P308L (c.923C>T), in the CASQ2 gene. A novel heterozygous mutation, F189L, in CASQ2 gene was identified in one family with CPVT.Catecholamine-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial disorder caused by cardiac ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) or calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) gene mutations. We conclude that CPVT-causing CASQ2 missense mutations function as null alleles. The central role of RyR2 dysfunction in CASQ2 deficiency unifies the pathophysiologic mechanism underlying CPVT due to RyR2 or CASQ2 mutations and suggests a therapeutic approach for these inherited cardiac arrhythmias.Mutations of the RyR2 gene cause autosomal dominant CPVT, while mutations of the CASQ2 gene may cause an autosomal recessive or dominant form of CPVT. Mutations of two myocardial calcium signaling molecules, ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2) and calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2), may cause catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), a severe inherited arrhythmic disease manifesting with salvoes of exercise-induced bidirectional and polymorphic tachycardias. These data, combined with our previous findings, show that RYR2 mutations are present in at least 6/16 (38%) of the catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia families, while CASQ2 mutations must be a rare cause of CPVT.This report reviews evidence that a missense mutation in the CASQ2 gene is associated with autosomal-recessive CPVT.An Australian cohort of 252 unrelated familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients were screened for mutations in the Ca(2+) regulatory genes, sorcin (SRI), calstabin (FKBP1B), calsequestrin (CASQ2), phospholamban (PLN), sarcolipin (SLN), calreticulin (CALR3) and calmodulin (CALM). A total of 17 exonic DNA variants were identified in the 7 Ca(2+) regulatory genes studied, of which 4 were considered of pathogenic significance. Two novel mutations in the CALR3 gene were identified (Lys82Arg, Arg73Gln) and one truncation mutation in the PLN gene (Leu39Ter). A variant was also identified in the CASQ2 gene (Asp63Glu).

In humans, GABARAPL1 shares 86% identity with GABARAP and 61% with GABARAPL2 (GATE-16).The selectivity is mediated by autophagy receptors, such as p62 and NBR1, which can bind to autophagic effector proteins (Atg8 in yeast, MAP1LC3 protein family in mammals) anchored in the membrane of autophagosomes.ATG3 is the E2-like enzyme necessary for ATG8/LC3 lipidation during autophagy.Recently, autophagy receptors, like p62/SQSTM1 and NBR1, which physically link autophagic cargo to ATG8/MAP1-LC3/GABARAP family members located on the forming autophagic membranes, have been identified.At least eight different Atg8 orthologs belonging to two subfamilies (LC3 and GATE-16/GABARAP) occur in mammalian cells, but their individual roles and modes of action are largely unknown.truncated DeltaN63 Atg4D displays increased activity against the Atg8 paralogue, gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein-like 1 (GABARAP-L1)Structure of GATE-16, membrane transport modulator and mammalian ortholog of autophagocytosis factor Aut7p.The yeast ortholog of GATE-16 is the autophagocytosis factor Aut7p. GATE-16 is also closely related to the GABA receptor-associated protein (GABARAP),Three human Atg8 (hAtg8) homologs, LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16, have been characterized as modifiers in reactions mediated by hAtg7 (an E1-like enzyme) and hAtg3 (an E2-like enzyme) as in yeast Atg8 lipidation, but their final targets have not been identified.\"}, {\"question\": \"List all clinical trials of the polypill.\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"'Use of a Multidrug Pill In Reducing cardiovascular Events' (UMPIRE) trial, European Clinical Trials database, as EudraCT: 2009-016278-34 and the Clinical Trials Registry, India as CTRI/2010/091/000250.\\n'IMProving Adherence using Combination Therapy (IMPACT)', Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN12606000067572).\\n'Kanyini Guidelines Adherence with the Polypill (Kanyini-GAP)'\\nPhase II study of the Polycap, double-blind, randomised trial, registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00443794\\nSecond Indian Polycap Study, TIPS-2\\nCluster Randomized Usual Care vs Caduet Investigation Assessing Long-term-risk (CRUCIAL trial)\\nGEMINI trial, 14-week, open-label trial conducted in 1220 patients from the USA\\nGEMINI-Australia, Asia, Latin America, Africa/Middle East (AALA) study \\nJEWEL study program, with JEWEL 1 conducted among 1138 patients from the UK and Canada and JEWEL 2 conducted in 1107 patients from Europe\\nCAPABLE54, the Clinical Utility of Caduet in Simultaneously Achieving Blood Pressure and Lipid End Points , in the USA\\nCUSP (The Caduet\\u00ae in an Untreated Subject Population trial)\\nTOGETHER trial\\nA randomised controlled trial in seven countries \\u2013 Australia, Brazil, India, Netherlands , New Zealand , United Kingdom  and United States.

Together, these findings suggest that combining TTFields therapy with chemotherapy may provide an additive efficacy benefit in the management of NSCLC.Response patterns of recurrent glioblastomas treated with tumor-treating fields.NovoTTF Therapy is a novel and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antimitotic treatment for recurrent GBM with potential benefits compared with other options. Recurrent GBM patients from two prior trials with demonstrated radiologic tumor response to single-agent NovoTTF Therapy were analyzed to better characterize tumor response patterns and evaluate the associations between response, compliance, and OS. In addition, a compartmental tumor growth model was developed and evaluated for its ability to predict GBM response to tumor-treating fields (TTFields). The overall response rate across both trials was 15% (4% complete responses): 14% in the phase III trial (14/120) and 20% (2/10) in a pilot study. Tumor responses to NovoTTF Therapy developed slowly (median time to response, 5.2 months) but were durable (median duration, 12.9 months).NovoTTF Therapy is a novel antimitotic treatment for recurrent GBM associated with slowly developing but durable tumor responses in approximately 15% of patients.The effect of field strength on glioblastoma multiforme response in patients treated with the NovoTTF\\u2122-100A system. An ongoing trial is assessing its efficacy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and it has been FDA-approved for recurrent GBM.We present three patients with GBM in whom the fields were adjusted at recurrence and the effects of each adjustment.The first patient underwent subtotal resection, radiotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ), and then began NovoTTF Therapy with metronomic TMZ.  A second patient underwent two resections followed by radiotherapy/TMZ and NovoTTF Therapy/TMZ. Six months later, two new distal lesions were noted, and he underwent further resection with adjustment of his fields. He remained stable over the subsequent year on NovoTTF Therapy and bevacizumab. A third patient on NovoTTF Therapy/TMZ remained stable for two years but developed a small, slow growing enhancing lesion, which was resected, and his fields were adjusted accordingly. A phase I/II trial of Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy in combination with pemetrexed for advanced non-small cell lung cancer.Promising preclinical data have led to a single arm phase I/II trial in NSCLC patients.METHODS: Forty-two inoperable stage IIIB (with pleural effusion) and IV NSCLC patients who had had tumor progression received pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) iv q3w together with daily TTFields therapy until disease progression.The median time to in-field progression was 28 weeks and the median time to systemic progression was 22 weeks.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of TTFields and pemetrexed as a second line therapy for NSCLC is safe and potentially more effective than pemetrexed alone. TTFields improved disease control within the treatment field and a phase III study is planned to further investigate its role as a novel treatment in NSCLC.Tumor treating fields (TTFields) is a noninvasive, regional antimitotic treatment modality that has been approved for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma by the U.S. FDA and has a CE mark in Europe. The antimitotic effect of TTFields therapy has been demonstrated in multiple cell lines when the appropriate frequency was utilized. A phase III trial of TTFields monotherapy compared to active chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma patients established that TTFields therapy is associated with minimal toxicity, better quality of life, and comparable efficacy to chemotherapy.

Long-term survival of patients suffering from glioblastoma multiforme treated with tumor-treating fields.Tumor-treating fields (TTField) therapy is a novel treatment technique that has recently received CE and FDA approval for the treatment of RGBM, and is based on the principle that low intensity, intermediate frequency electric fields (100 to 300 kHz) may induce apoptosis in specific cell types. Our center was the first to apply TTField treatment to histologically proven GBM in a small pilot study of 20 individuals in 2004 and 2005, and four of those original 20 patients are still alive today. We report two cases of GBM and two cases of RGBM treated by TTField therapy, all in good health and no longer receiving any treatment more than seven years after initiating TTField therapy, with no clinical or radiological evidence of recurrence.Tumor treating fields (TTFields) are low intensity (1 ? 2 V/cm), intermediate frequency (100 ? 200 kHz) alternating electric fields administered using insulated electrodes placed on the skin surrounding the region of a malignant tumor. Furthermore, it summarizes the clinical experience with TTFields, mainly in two indications: one in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme: in a large prospective randomized Phase III trial TTFields was compared with best standard care (including chemotherapy): TTFields significantly improved median overall survival (OS) compared with standard therapy (7.8 vs 6.1 months) for the patients treated per protocol.The second indication was a Phase II study in second-line non-small cell lung cancer, where TTFields was administered concomitantly with pemetrexed. EXPERT OPINION: The proof of concept of TTFields has been well demonstrated in the preclinical setting, and the clinical data seem promising in various tumor types. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that TTFields alone and in combination with paclitaxel and doxorubicin effectively reduce the viability of both wild type and MDR cell sub-lines and thus can potentially be used as an effective treatment of drug resistant tumors.Alternating electric fields (TTFields) inhibit metastatic spread of solid tumors to the lungs.Tumor treating fields (TTFields) are low intensity, intermediate frequency, alternating electric fields used to treat cancerous tumors. This novel treatment modality effectively inhibits the growth of solid tumors in vivo and has shown promise in pilot clinical trials in patients with advanced stage solid tumors.BACKGROUND: The present study explores the efficacy and toxicity of combining a new, non-toxic, cancer treatment modality, termed Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields), with chemotherapeutic treatment in-vitro, in-vivo and in a pilot clinical trial.In addition, we studied the effects of combining chemotherapy with TTFields in an animal tumor model and in a pilot clinical trial in recurrent and newly diagnosed GBM patients.RESULTS: The efficacy of TTFields-chemotherapy combination in-vitro was found to be additive with a tendency towards synergism for all drugs and cell lines tested (combination indexA pilot study with very low-intensity, intermediate-frequency electric fields in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open, prospective pilot study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy profile of TTFields treatment in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors using the NovoTTF100A(TM) device.Outcomes showed 1 partial response of a treated skin metastasis from a primary breast cancer, 3 cases where tumor growth was arrested during treatment, and 1 case of disease progression. One mesothelioma patient experienced lesion regression near TTFields with simultaneous tumor stability or progression in distal areas.CONCLUSION: Although the number of patients in this study is small, the lack of therapy toxicity and the efficacy observed in data gathered to date indicate the potential of TTFields as a new treatment modality for solid tumors, definitely warranting further investigation.Mitotic disruption and reduced clonogenicity of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by tumor treating fields.OBJECTIVES: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are a non-invasive cancer treatment modality approved for the treatment of patients with recurrent glioblastoma. The present study determined the efficacy and mechanism of action of TTFields in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer.RESULTS: Application of TTFields in vitro showed a significant decrease in cell count, an increase in cell volume and reduced clonogenicity. Further analysis demonstrated significant increase in the number of abnormal mitotic figures, as well as a decrease in G2-M cell population. In hamsters with orthotopic pancreatic tumors, TTFields significantly reduced tumor volume accompanied by an increase in the frequency of abnormal mitotic events. TTFields efficacy was enhanced both in vitro and in vivo when combined with chemotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first evidence that TTFields serve as an effective antimitotic treatment in preclinical pancreatic cancer models and have a long term negative effect on cancer cell survival. These results make TTFields an attractive candidate for testing in the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer.Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are a non-invasive cancer treatment modality approved for the treatment of patients with recurrent glioblastoma.In addition, a compartmental tumor growth model was developed and evaluated for its ability to predict GBM response to tumor-treating fields (TTFields).Tumor-treating fields (TTField) therapy is a novel treatment technique that has recently received CE and FDA approval for the treatment of RGBM, and is based on the principle that low intensity, intermediate frequency electric fields (100 to 300 kHz) may induce apoptosis in specific cell types.Tumor treating fields (TTFields) is a noninvasive, regional antimitotic treatment modality that has been approved for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma by the U.S. FDA and has a CE mark in Europe.Tumor-treating fields (TTField) therapy is a novel treatment technique that has recently received CE and FDA approval for the treatment of RGBM, and is based on the principle that low intensity, intermediate frequency electric fields (100 to 300 kHz) may induce apoptosis in specific cell types.

We used tissue derived from Dnm2-deficient mice to establish an appropriate peripheral nerve model and found that dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B-associated dynamin 2 mutants, but not autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy mutants, impaired myelination. Mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) lead to dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B, while a different set of DNM2 mutations cause autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy.

This disorder is not only associated with a higher risk of appearance of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events, but impacts on the liver in different ways. Nonalcbolic syndrome (MS) components, such as dyslipidemia, prothrombotic status, and increased blood pressure, are risk factors for patients with renal disease. Visceral fat mass is closely related to the MS and atherosclerosis. We investigated the effects of body compositions and MS on anemia parameters and recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) requirements in maintenance hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Body composition (body mass index and bioimpedance analysis) and laboratory data were obtained from 110 dialysis patients. The MS was identified according to ATP-III criteria. Anemia parameters, hemoglobin (Hgb), albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), calcium, phosphorus, parathormone levels, and rHuEPO requirements over the last 6 months were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Patients with the MS seem to reach target Hgb levels more frequently (10-12 g/dL; 66.3% vs 84.8%; P = .03) without any difference in total intravenous iron therapy dosage. MS patients also required lower rHuEPO for reaching similar Hgb levels compared with patients without MS (2679.3 \\u00b1 1936.1 vs 3702.5 \\u00b1 2213.0 U/kg/6 mo; P = .02). There webolic syndrome (MetS) is typically diagnosed based on abnormalities in specific clustered clinical measures that are associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, current MetS criteria result in racial/ethnic discrepancies. Our goals were to use confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to delineate differential contributions to MetS by sub-group, and if contributions were discovered, develop sex and racial/ethnic-specific equations to calculate MetS severity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data on adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2010, we performed a CFA of a single MetS factor that allowed differential loadings across groups, resulting in a sex and race/ethnicity-specific continuous MetS severity score. RESULTS: Loadings to the single MetS factor differed by sub-group for each MetS component (p<0.001), with lower factor loadings among non-Hispanic-blacks for triglycerides and among Hispanics for waist circumference. Systolic blood pressure exhibited low factor loadings among all groups. MetS severity scores were correlated with biomarkers of future disease (high-sensitivity C-reactive-protein, uric acid, insulin resistance). Non-Hispanic-black-males with diabetics had a low prevalence of MetS but high MetS severity scores that were not significantly different from other racial/ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis among adults uniquely demonstrated differences between sexes and racial/ethnic groups regarding contributions of traditional MetS components to an assumed single factor. The resulting equations provide a clinically-accessible and interpretable continuous measure of MetS for potential use in identifying adults at higher risk for MetS-related diseases and following changes within individuals over time.

Somatic mutation of the EGFR signalling pathway is a prevalent mechanism of resistance to cetuximab (Nature 486(7404):532-536, 2012). If the human genome harbours variants that influence susceptibility of the EGFR pathway to oncogenic mutation, such variants could also be prognostic for cetuximab responsiveness. KRAS mutations are strong predictors for clinical outcomes of EGFR-targeted treatments such as cetuximab and panitumumab in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).KRAS mutation is widely accepted as a strong, negative predictive marker for anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies, including cetuximab and panitumumab. KRAS status is now a mandatory prerequisite in order to treat metastatic colorectal patients with anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) antibodies, such as cetuximab or panitumumab. KRAS mutations are unambiguously linked to a lack of response to these targeted therapies.The EGFR-R497K polymorphism is a potential predictor for overall survival in HNSCC patients treated with cetuximab based therapy in the palliative setting.Laboratories are increasingly required to perform molecular tests for the detection of mutations in the KRAS gene in metastatic colorectal cancers to allow better clinical management and more effective treatment for these patients. KRAS mutation status predicts a patient's likely response to the monoclonal antibody cetuximab.KRAS mutation has been unambiguously identified as a marker of resistance to cetuximab-based treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients.  This study suggested EGF A+61G polymorphism to be a predictive marker for pCR, independent of KRAS mutation status, to cetuximab-based neoadjuvant chemoradiation of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.Intratumoral gene expression levels of EGFR, VEGFR2 and NRP as well as polymorphisms in FCGR3A, CyclinD1 and EGFR could predict clinical outcome in mCRC patients enrolled in BOND2, independent of KRAS mutation status.Numerous clinical studies have shown that anti-EGFR therapies are effective only in a subset of patients with colorectal cancer. Even though mutations in the KRAS gene have been confirmed as negative predictors of the response to EGFR-targeted therapies, not all KRAS wild-type (wt-KRAS) patients will respond to treatment. Recent studies have demonstrated that additionally wild-type BRAF (wt-BRAF) genotype is required for response to panitumumab or cetuximab, suggesting that BRAF genotype criteria should be used together with KRAS genotype for selecting the patients who are about to benefit from the anti-EGFR therapy.KRAS mutation is a dramatic example of single nucleotide polymorphism, which is able to identify a priori patients that could receive or not an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody such as cetuximab or panitumumab. While confirming the negative effect of KRAS mutations on outcome after cetuximab, we show that BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations are significantly associated with a low response rate.Cetuximab and panitumumab, mAbs targeting EGFR, are registered for metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients whose tumors express EGFR as determined by immunohistochemistry. However, this method is not predictive of treatment efficacy.. This study suggests that TP53 mutations are predictive of cetuximab sensitivity, particularly in patients without KRAS mutation, and that TP53 genotyping could have a clinical interest to select patients who should benefit from cetuximab-based CT.A KRAS mutation confers resistance to cetuximab, which reduces treatment options, especially in first-line.

RAM activates and stabilizes RNMT and thus is critical for cellular cap methylation and cell viability.Synthesis of the methyl cap initiates with the addition of 7-methylguanosine to the initiating nucleotide of RNA pol II (polymerase II) transcripts, which occurs predominantly during transcription and in mammals is catalysed by RNGTT (RNA guanylyltransferase and 5' phosphatase) and RNMT (RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase).The RNMT-activating subunit, RAM (RNMT-activating miniprotein), is also recruited to transcription initiation sites via an interaction with RNMT.Phosphorylation of the CTD recruits RNGTT and RNMT, the enzymes involved in mRNA capping, to the nascent transcript.Myc induces methyl cap formation by promoting RNA polymerase II phosphorylation which recruits the capping enzymes to RNA, and by up-regulating the enzyme SAHH (S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase), which neutralizes the inhibitory by-product of methylation reactions.In the present study, we identify the methyltransferase responsible for cap1 formation in human cells, which we call hMTr1 (also known as FTSJD2 and ISG95).The guanylyltransferase (GTP:mRNA guanylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.50) reaction responsible for cap formation usually proceeds via a covalent enzyme-GMP intermediate.The methylation of the 5' terminal guanosine residue of the cap structure of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) mRNAs has been shown to occur in vitro concomitantly with their synthesis (R.

Consistent with this, purified MAYP bundled F-actin and regulated its turnover in vitro.In addition, MAYP colocalized with cortical and filopodial F-actin in vivo.Because filopodia are postulated to increase directional motility by acting as environmental sensors, the MAYP-stimulated increase in directional movement may be at least partly explained by enhancement of filopodia formation.We report an unexpected direct association between fascin, an actin-bundling component of filopodia, microspikes and lamellipodial ribs, and protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha), a regulator of focal adhesions.Fascin is an actin-bundling protein involved in filopodia assembly and cancer invasion and metastasis of multiple epithelial cancer types.Actin-crosslinking proteins organize actin into highly dynamic and architecturally diverse subcellular scaffolds that orchestrate a variety of mechanical processes, including lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions in motile cells.IRSp53, a multi-domain protein that can associate with the Rho-GTPases Rac and Cdc42, participates in these processes mainly through its amino-terminal IMD (IRSp53 and MIM domain). The isolated IMD has actin-bundling activity in vitro and is sufficient to induce filopodia in vivo.Eps8 activates and synergizes with IRSp53 in mediating actin bundling in vitro, enhancing IRSp53-dependent membrane extensions in vivo.Consistently, Cdc42-induced filopodia are inhibited following individual removal of either IRSp53 or Eps8.Collectively, these results support a model whereby the synergic bundling activity of the IRSp53-Eps8 complex, regulated by Cdc42, contributes to the generation of actin bundles, thus promoting filopodial protrusions.The bundling activity of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein is required for filopodium formationFilopodia are highly dynamic finger-like cell protrusions filled with parallel bundles of actin filaments. Previously we have shown that Diaphanous-related formin dDia2 is involved in the formation of filopodia. Another key player for the formation of filopodia across many species is vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP).It has been proposed that the essential role of VASP for formation of filopodia is its competition with capping proteins for filament barbed-end interaction.Only WT DdVASP, but not a mutant lacking the F-actin bundling activity, could rescue the ability of these cells to form WT-like filopodia.Our data suggest that DdVASP is complexed with dDia2 in filopodial tips and support formin-mediated filament elongation by bundling nascent actin filaments.Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 (IRSp53) has been identified as an SH3 domain-containing adaptor that links Rac1 with a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family verprolin-homologous protein 2 (WAVE2) to induce lamellipodia or Cdc42 with Mena to induce filopodia.Here, we show that the N-terminal predicted helical stretch of 250 amino acids of IRSp53 is an evolutionarily conserved F-actin bundling domain involved in filopodium formation.The IMD alone, derived from either IRSp53 or MIM, induced filopodia in HeLa cells and the formation of tightly packed parallel F-actin bundles in vitro.These results suggest that IRSp53 and MIM belong to a novel actin bundling protein family.Role of the actin bundling protein fascin in growth cone morphogenesis: localization in filopodia and lamellipodiaFascin localized to radially oriented actin bundles in lamellipodia (ribs) and filopodia.Using a fascin antibody and a GFP fascin construct, we found that fascin incorporated into actin bundles from the beginning of growth cone formation at the cut end of axons.Later, during growth cone morphogenesis when actin ribs shortened, the proximal fascin-free zone of bundles increased, but fascin was retained in the distal, filopodial portion of bundles.Treatment with tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which phosphorylates fascin and decreases its affinity for actin, resulted in loss of all actin bundles from growth cones.Our findings suggest that fascin may be particularly important for the linear structure and dynamics of filopodia and for lamellipodial rib dynamics by regulating filament organization in bundles.\"}, {\"question\": \"List clinical trials for prevention of sarcopenia\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Several clinical trials with androgen replacement therapy. \\nStudy was to evaluate the effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on the rate of muscle protein synthesis.

Loss-of-function truncation mutations in EMD, encoding the nuclear membrane protein emerin, cause X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) characterized by localized contractures and skeletal myopathy in adolescence, sinus node dysfunction (SND) in early adulthood, and atrial fibrillation as a variably associated trait.Mutation of EMD can underlie X-linked familial AF. Lys37del is associated with epithelial cell emerin deficiency, as in EDMD, yet it causes electrical atriomyopathy in the absence of skeletal muscle disease. Targeted genetic testing of EMD should be considered in patients with SND-associated AF and/or family history suggesting X-linked inheritance.The Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is a form of muscular dystrophy that frequently presents early contractures and cardiac conduction defects, caused by emerin deficiency in the inner nuclear membrane of the muscular fibers.compatible with X-linked inheritance formThe first patient was a member of a family with molecularly proven X-linked EDMD.As these resemble the cardiac features of patients with the autosomal dominant variant of EDMD, we examined the lamin A/C gene, identifying a de-novo mutation in the propositus.contribute to disease severity in autosomal dominant EDMD.The STA gene encodes emerin and is one of the genes that is affected in Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). Although it has been reported that EDMD caused by the STA gene mutation is associated with X-linked recessive inheritance, the genotype-phenotype correlations, with special reference to cardiac manifestations, are not well defined.Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a muscular disorder characterized by 1) early contracture of the elbows. Achilles tendons and post-cervical muscles, 2) slowly progressive muscle wasting and weakness with a humeroperoneal distribution, and 3) life-threatening cardiomyopathy with conduction block. Most of families with EDMD show X-linked recessive inheritance with mutations in the STA gene on chromosome Xq28, which encodes a protein named emerin. A rare autosomal dominant form of EDMD (AD-EDMD) is caused by mutations in lamin A/C gene (LMNA) on chromosome 1q21. Both emerin and lamin A/C are located in the inner surface membrane of the nucleus.Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive myopathy. The patient had no familial background of the disease. This patient might have a sporadic inheritance pattern with severe cardiac involvement.autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy,Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is characterized by the clinical triad of early onset contractures of elbows, Achilles tendons and spine, wasting and weakness with a predominantly humero-peroneal distribution and life-threatening cardiac conduction defects and/or cardiomyopathy. Two main types of inheritance have been described: the X-linked form is caused by mutations in the STA gene on locus Xq28 and the gene for the autosomal dominant form (LMNA gene) has been localized on chromosome 1q11-q23. Recently, mutations in this LMNA gene have been also found to be responsible for the less frequent autosomal recessive form of the disease.Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is characterized by early contractures of elbows and Achilles tendons, slowly progressive muscle wasting and weakness, and a cardiomyopathy with conduction blocks which is life-threatening. Two modes of inheritance exist, X-linked (OMIM 310300) and autosomal dominant (EDMD-AD; OMIM 181350). EDMD-AD is clinically identical to the X-linked forms of the disease. Mutations in EMD, the gene encoding emerin, are responsible for the X-linked form.including X-linked Emery-Dreifuss MD,this form is not X-linked Emery-Dreifuss MD. We suggest that these patients represent a severe MD characterized by early onset distal wasting and severe rigidity of the spine, with probable autosomal recessive inheritance.Seventeen families with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) have been studied both by DNA sequencing and by emerin protein expression. Fourteen had mutations in the X-linked emerin gene, while three showed evidence of autosomal inheritance. Twelve of the 14 emerin mutations caused early termination of translation.One family presented a rare autosomal dominant variant of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, another with X-linked recessive inheritance showed unusual intrafamilial variability.Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EMD) is characterised by (1) early contractures of the Achilles tendons, elbows, and postcervical muscles, (2) slowly progressive muscle wasting and weakness with a predominantly humeroperoneal distribution in the early stages, and (3) cardiomyopathy with conduction defects and risk of sudden death. Inheritance is usually X linked recessive but can be autosomal dominant.Tendon contractures may be a partial expression of this myopathic disorder, suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance. A muscular dystrophy clinically similar to that of the Emery-Dreifuss (EDMD) type can thus occur in women.Since the disease was diagnosed in 3 brothers, the X-coupled recessive type of its inheritance is assumed. An opinion is advanced that the described form is a clinical variety of Emery-Dreyfus myodystrophy.Emery-Dreifuss syndrome (EDS)the term Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy should be avoided. Instead, each case of EDS should be classified as myopathic or neurogenic with X chromosome recessive or autosomal dominant inheritance.Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is a syndrome with five salient features: early and unusual contractures; humeroperoneal muscle wasting; the slow progression of weakness, beginning in childhood; cardiac conduction defects; and X-linked inheritance. We present two cases and detail other reports with a similar constellation of findings with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance.Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy with proximal weakness in both the upper and lower limbs and X-linked scapuloperoneal muscular dystrophy represent the same disorder.There is at least one other report of autosomal dominant transmission of this clinical picture, which had previously only been reported as Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy with X-linked recessive inheritance.\"}, {\"question\": \"Which genes are regulated by TRalpha2  in the heart?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"ARB1, ARB2, TAK1, p38, TRalpha1\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"ARB1\"], [\"ARB2\"], [\"TAK1\"], [\"p38\"], [\"TRalpha1\"]], \"context\": \"n FM the reduced mRNA expression of ARB1 (p<0.05, -37%) and ARB2 (p<0.05, -42%) was associated with a reduction of the messenger for TRalpha1 (p<0.05, -85%) and TRalpha2 (p<0.05, -73%).hese data reveal that in human heart failure the reduction of beta-adrenergic receptors is associated with reduced expression of both TRalpha1 and TRalpha2 isoforms of thyroid hormone receptors.Mitigating TRalpha1 effects, both TRalpha2 and TRbeta1 attenuate TRalpha1-induced myocardial growth and gene expression by diminishing TAK1 and p38 activities, respectively.Selective ablation of TRalpha2 resulted in an inevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1.These data reveal that in human heart failure the reduction of beta-adrenergic receptors is associated with reduced expression of both TRalpha1 and TRalpha2 isoforms of thyroid hormone receptors.\"}, {\"question\": \"List available methods for transmembrane protein topology prediction.\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"HMMpTM, MetaTM, Philius, HMM_RA, HMMTOP, MEMSAT3, HMM-TM, TMHMM, Phobius and SignalP.\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"HMMpTM\"], [\"MetaTM\"], [\"Philius\"], [\"HMM_RA\"], [\"HMMTOP\"], [\"MEMSAT3\"], [\"HMM-TM\"], [\"TMHMM\"], [\"Phobius\"], [\"SignalP\"]], \"context\": \"HMMpTM: improving transmembrane protein topology prediction using phosphorylation and glycosylation site predictionWe report the development of a Hidden Markov Model based method, capable of predicting the topology of transmembrane proteins and the existence of kinase specific phosphorylation and N/O-linked glycosylation sites along the protein sequence.

On a large data set comprising 1460 sequences of TM proteins with known topologies and 2362 globular protein sequences it correctly predicts 86.7% of all topologies. CONCLUSION: Combining several TM predictors in a consensus prediction framework improves overall accuracy compared to any of the individual methods.

The method achieves topology prediction accuracy of 89%, while signal peptides and re-entrant helices are predicted with 93% and 44% accuracy respectively.

Based on the observation that there are functional domains that occur preferentially internal or external to the membrane, we have extended the model of TMHMM to incorporate functional domains, using a probabilistic approach originally developed for computational gene finding. Our extension is better than TMHMM in predicting the topology of transmembrane proteins. As prediction of functional domain improves, our system's prediction accuracy will likely improve as wellHere, we present Phobius, a combined transmembrane protein topology and signal peptide predictor. The predictor is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the different sequence regions of a signal peptide and the different regions of a transmembrane protein in a series of interconnected states. Training was done on a newly assembled and curated dataset. Compared to TMHMM and SignalP, errors coming from cross-prediction between transmembrane segments and signal peptides were reduced substantially by Phobius. False classifications of signal peptides were reduced from 26.1% to 3.9% and false classifications of transmembrane helices were reduced from 19.0% to 7.7%. Phobius was applied to the proteomes of Homo sapiens and Escherichia coli.

Sequences encoding different membrane-tethered fluorescent proteins were arranged in pairs within cassettes flanked by recombination sites. Flybow combines the Gal4-upstream activating sequence binary system to regulate transgene expression and an inducible modified Flp-FRT system to drive inversions and excisions of cassettes. This provides spatial and temporal control over the stochastic expression of one of two or four reporters within one sample. Using the visual system, the embryonic nervous system and the wing imaginal disc, we show that Flybow in conjunction with specific Gal4 drivers can be used to visualize cell morphology with high resolution. Finally, we demonstrate that this labeling approach is compatible with available Flp-FRT-based techniques, such as mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker; this could further support the genetic analysis of neural circuit assembly and function.Drosophila Brainbow: a recombinase-based fluorescence labeling technique to subdivide neural expression patterns.We developed a multicolor neuron labeling technique in Drosophila melanogaster that combines the power to specifically target different neural populations with the label diversity provided by stochastic color choice. This adaptation of vertebrate Brainbow uses recombination to select one of three epitope-tagged proteins detectable by immunofluorescence. Two copies of this construct yield six bright, separable colors. We used Drosophila Brainbow to study the innervation patterns of multiple antennal lobe projection neuron lineages in the same preparation and to observe the relative trajectories of individual aminergic neurons. Nerve bundles, and even individual neurites hundreds of micrometers long, can be followed with definitive color labeling. We traced motor neurons in the subesophageal ganglion and correlated them to neuromuscular junctions to identify their specific proboscis muscle targets. The ability to independently visualize multiple lineage or neuron projections in the same preparation greatly advances the goal of mapping how neurons connect into circuits.Brainbow: new resources and emerging biological applications for multicolor genetic labeling and analysis.\"}, {\"question\": \"Which growth factors are known to be involved in the induction of EMT?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"EMT is characterized by acquisition of cell motility, modifications of cell morphology, and cell dissociation correlating with the loss of desmosomes from the cellular cortex.

Our recent studies found that CCN1 plays a critical role in pancreatic carcinogenesis through the induction of EMT and stemness.Here we show that CCN1 regulates the Sonic Hedgehog (SHh) signaling pathway, which is associated with the PDAC progression and poor prognosis.SHh regulation by CCN1 in pancreatic cancer cells is mediated through the active Notch-1.These extensive studies propose that targeting CCN1 can provide a new treatment option for patients with pancreatic cancer since blocking CCN1 simultaneously blocks two critical pathways (i.e. SHh and Notch1) associated with the development of the disease as well as drug resistance.GF-\\u03b2-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transitionThe cytokine TGF-\\u03b2, which is expressed by tumor-infiltrating immune cells, stands out as a master regulator of the pro-invasive tumor microenvironment. TGF-\\u03b2 cooperates with stem cell pathways, such as Wnt and Ras signaling, to induce EMT. In addition, TGF-\\u03b2 contributes to an EMT-permissive microenvironment by switching the phenotypes of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, which thereby mount pro-invasive and pro-metastatic immune responses.In this review, we discuss the role of TGF-\\u03b2-induced EMT as a link between cancer and inflammation in the context of questions, which from our point of view are key to answer in order to understand the functionality of EMT in tumors.ranscription factors c-Myc and CDX2 mediate E-selectin ligand expression in colon cancer cells undergoing EGF/bFGF-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transitionTreatment of HT29 and DLD-1 cells with EGF and/or basic FGF (bFGF) induced EMT and significantly increased sLe(x/a) expression resulting in enhanced E-selectin binding activity.Upon hypoxia, TGF\\u03b2 addition or EGFRvIII expression, MCF7, A549 and NMuMG epithelial cells acquired a spindle shape and lost cell-cell contacts. Expression of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin decreased, whereas mesenchymal markers such as vimentin and N-cadherin increased.The EMT process can be regulated by a diverse array of cytokines and growth factors, such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, whose activities are dysregulated during malignant tumor progression.Transforming growth factor-beta-induced tubular cell EMT in C1.1 cells was inhibited by MMP-2/9 inhibitor. Our in vitro study provides evidence that MMPs, specifically MMP-9, secreted by effector macrophages can induce tubular cell EMT and thereby contribute to renal fibrosis.nflammatory cytokines augments TGF-beta1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in A549 cells by up-regulating TbetaR-IIn this study, we report that cytomix (a mixture of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma) significantly enhances TGF-beta1-induced EMT in A549 cells as evidenced by acquisition of fibroblast-like cell shape, loss of E-cadherin, and reorganization of F-actin.IL-1beta or TNF-alpha alone can also augment TGF-beta1-induced EMT. However, a combination of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha or the cytomix is more potent to induce EMT.These results indicate that inflammatory cytokines together with TGF-beta1 may play an important role in the development of fibrosis and tumor progress via the mechanism of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.TGF-beta stimulated epithelial to mesenchyme transdifferentiation (EMT) in the presence of TGF-alpha, as characterized by increased expression of fibronectin and changes in TGF-beta receptor binding.EMT is typically induced by transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and inhibited by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF).Exposure of MDCK cells to 10 ng/ml TGF-beta1 for 72 h induced EMT as evidenced by conversion to the spindle-like morphology, loss of E-cadherin, and activation of alpha-smooth muscle actin.In contrast, Akt1 down-regulation in IGF-IR-stimulated cells promoted dramatic neomorphic effects characteristic of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhanced cell migration induced by IGF-I or EGF stimulation. The phenotypic effects of Akt1 down-regulation were accompanied by enhanced extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) activation, which contributed to the induction of migration and EMT.ransforming growth factors beta (TGF-betas) inhibit growth of epithelial cells and induce differentiation changes, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).Ha-Ras cooperates with transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) to cause epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) characterized by spindle-like cell morphology, loss of epithelial markers, and induction of mesenchymal markers.IGF-II induces rapid beta-catenin relocation to the nucleus during epithelium to mesenchyme transitionWe can show that (1) IGF-II induces a rapid epithelium to mesenchymal transition;Based on the given case of IGF-II and E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex, this study reveals the backbone of a cascade connecting growth factor signaling with cell-cell adhesion during EMT.The NBT-II rat carcinoma cell line exhibits two mutually exclusive responses to FGF-1 and EGF, entering mitosis at cell confluency while undergoing an epithelium-to-mesenchyme transition (EMT) when cultured at subconfluency.EMT requires continuous TGFbeta receptor (TGFbeta-R) and oncogenic Ras signaling and is stabilized by autocrine TGFbeta productionEMT seems to be a close in vitro correlate of metastasis, both requiring synergism between TGFbeta-R and Raf/MAPK signaling\"}, {\"question\": \"Which histone modification discriminates between active and poised enhancers?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Monomethylation of histone H3 on Lys 4 (H3K4me1) and acetylation of histone H3 on Lys 27 (H3K27ac) are histone modifications that are highly enriched over the body of actively transcribed genes and on enhancers. \"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"H3K4me1\"], [\"H3K27ac\"]], \"context\": \"Monomethylation of histone H3 on Lys 4 (H3K4me1) and acetylation of histone H3 on Lys 27 (H3K27ac) are histone modifications that are highly enriched over the body of actively transcribed genes and on enhancerSince Trr and mammalian Mll3/4 complexes are distinguished by bearing a unique subunit, the H3K27 demethylase UTX, we propose a model in which the H3K4 monomethyltransferases Trr/Mll3/Mll4 and the H3K27 demethylase UTX cooperate to regulate the transition from inactive/poised to active enhancers.We used ChIP-seq to measure changes in histone H3K27 acetylation, a mark of active enhancers, to identify enhancers in myelinating rat peripheral nerve and their dynamics after demyelinating nerve injury.However, the majority of Egr2-bound enhancers retain H3K27ac, indicating that other transcription factors maintain active enhancer status after nerve injury.Recent studies using mammalian cells showed that a chromatin state signature is associated with active developmental enhancers, defined by high levels of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) and strong depletion of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3Such permissive binding was largely restricted to open-chromatin regions showing histone modification marks characteristic of active enhancer and promoter regions, whereas open-chromatin regions lacking such marks did not show permissive binding.

The functions of enhancers and super-enhancers are influenced by, and affect, higher-order genomic organization. Defined by their magnitude of size, transcription factor density, and binding of transcriptional machinery, super-enhancers have been associated with genes driving cell differentiation.Here we review evidence for super-enhancer involvement in cancers, complex diseases, and developmental disorders and discuss interactions between super-enhancers and cofactors/chromatin regulators.The term 'super-enhancer' has been used to describe groups of putative enhancers in close genomic proximity with unusually high levels of Mediator binding, as measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq).In this respect, the super-enhancer definition is useful in identifying regulatory elements likely to control genes important for cell type specification.Super-enhancers (SEs), also known as stretch-enhancers, are a subset of enhancers especially important for genes associated with cell identity and genetic risk of disease. CD4(+) T cells are critical for host defence and autoimmunity.Super-enhancers and stretch enhancers (SEs) drive expression of genes that play prominent roles in normal and disease cells, but the functional importance of these clustered enhancer elements is poorly understood, so it is not clear why genes key to cell identity have evolved regulation by such elementsSuper-enhancers thus provide a platform for signaling pathways to regulate genes that control cell identity during development and tumorigenesis.Here we show that super-enhancers underlie the identity, lineage commitment and plasticity of adult stem cells in vivo.We show that super-enhancers and their dense clusters ('epicentres') of transcription factor binding sites undergo remodelling upon lineage progression.New fate is acquired by decommissioning old and establishing new super-enhancers and/or epicentres, an auto-regulatory process that abates one master regulator subset while enhancing another.Finally, we identify SOX9 as a crucial chromatin rheostat of hair follicle stem cell super-enhancers, and provide functional evidence that super-enhancers are dynamic, dense transcription-factor-binding platforms which are acutely sensitive to pioneer master regulators whose levels define not only spatial and temporal features of lineage-status but also stemness, plasticity in transitional states and differentiation.We demonstrate that hotspots are highly enriched in large super-enhancer regions (several kilobases), which drive the early adipogenic reprogramming of gene expression.Our results indicate that cooperativity between transcription factors at the level of hotspots as well as super-enhancers is very important for enhancer activity and transcriptional reprogramming. Thus, hotspots and super-enhancers\\u00a0constitute important regulatory hubs that serve to integrate external stimuli on chromatin.We report here that the ESC master transcription factors form unusual enhancer domains at most genes that control the pluripotent state. These domains, which we call super-enhancers, consist of clusters of enhancers that are densely occupied by the master regulators and Mediator.Super-enhancers differ from typical enhancers in size, transcription factor density and content, ability to activate transcription, and sensitivity to perturbationSuper-enhancers thus play key roles in the control of mammalian cell identity.Super-enhancers are large clusters of transcriptional enhancers that drive expression of genes that define cell identity.We describe here the population of transcription factors, cofactors, chromatin regulators, and transcription apparatus occupying super-enhancers in embryonic stem cells and evidence that super-enhancers are highly transcribed. Finally, we identify SOX9 as a crucial chromatin rheostat of hair follicle stem cell super-enhancers, and provide functional evidence that super-enhancers are dynamic, dense transcription-factor-binding platforms which are acutely sensitive to pioneer master regulators whose levels define not only spatial and temporal features of lineage-status but also stemness, plasticity in transitional states and differentiation.Inflammation-sensitive super enhancers form domains of coordinately regulated enhancer RNAs.NF-\\u03baB directs dynamic super enhancer formation in inflammation and atherogenesis.Pioneer factors govern super-enhancer dynamics in stem cell plasticity and lineage choice.\"}, {\"question\": \"Which are the cardiac effects of thyronamines?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Thyronamines have negative chronotropy, negative inotropy; in particular thyronamines are considered negative inotropic agents\", \"In the heart, thyronamines cause negative chronotropy, negative inotropy,reduced cardiac output and resistance to ischemic injury.\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"negative chronotropy\", \"lower heart rate\"], [\"negative inotropy\", \"negative inotropism\"], [\"resistance to ischemic injury\"], [\"reduced cardiac output\"]], \"context\": \"Most recently, thyroid hormone derivatives were identified, the thyronamines which are decarboxylated thyroid hormones initiating physiological actions like lowering body temperature and heart rate, thereby acting in opposite direction to the classical thyroid hormones.Intraperitoneal or central injection of 3-T(1)AM or T(0)AM into mice, rats, or Djungarian hamsters caused various prompt effects, such as metabolic depression, hypothermia, negative chronotropy, negative inotropy, hyperglycemia, reduction of the respiratory quotient, ketonuria, and reduction of fat mass. Functional effects have been observed after administration of exogenous T(1)AM: in the isolated heart, a negative inotropic and chronotropic action was produced, and the resistance to ischemic injury was increased, possibly as a consequence of an action on intracellular calcium homeostasis.Octopamine, beta-phenylethylamine, and tryptamine produced a dose-dependent negative inotropic effect as shown by reduced cardiac output (IC(50)=109 microM, 159 microM, and 242 microM, respectively). In the same preparation a similar effect was produced by thyronamine and 3-iodothyronamine, with IC(50)=94 microM and 27 microM, respectively.

Matuzumab combined with paclitaxel was generally well tolerated in patients with advanced NSCLC. This article focuses on anti-Her-2 therapy, specifically trastuzumab, as well as other epidermal growth factor receptor antagonists such as cetuximab, panitumub, matuzumab, nimotzumab, gefitinib, and erlotinib.Phase I study of matuzumab in combination with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and cisplatin (PLF) in patients with advanced gastric and esophagogastric adenocarcinomas.BACKGROUND: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of two different weekly doses of the fully humanized epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting monoclonal antibody matuzumab combined with high-dose 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and cisplatin (PLF) in the first-line treatment of patients with EGFR-positive advanced gastric and esophagogastric adenocarcinomas.Matuzumab and panitumumab have also been evaluated in phase II trials. Pemetrexed with or without matuzumab as second-line treatment for patients with stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer.INTRODUCTION: This randomized phase II study investigated pemetrexed in combination with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting monoclonal antibody matuzumab compared with pemetrexed alone as second-line therapy for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Matuzumab plus epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine (ECX) compared with epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine alone as first-line treatment in patients with advanced oesophago-gastric cancer: a randomised, multicentre open-label phase II study.BACKGROUND: Clinical data showed promising antitumour activity with feasible tolerability for matuzumab plus epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine (ECX) chemotherapy in untreated advanced oesophago-gastric (OG) cancer.  CONCLUSION: Matuzumab 800 mg weekly combined with ECX chemotherapy does not increase response or survival for patients with advanced OG cancer.In all studies, the patients had different types of advanced carcinoma - mainly colon, rectal and pancreatic cancer. They received matuzumab as multiple 1-hour intravenous infusions in a wide range of dosing regimens (development dataset: from 400 mg every 3 weeks to 2000 mg in the first week followed by 1600 mg weekly; evaluation dataset: from 100 mg weekly to 800 mg weekly).  Other anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, such as panitumumab, matuzumab, nimotuzumab, and ch806, are in different stages of development for the treatment of advanced NSCLC.Molecular determinants of response to matuzumab in combination with paclitaxel for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.Antibodies targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have proven to be effective in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that express EGFR. We recently published a phase I study of weekly matuzumab plus paclitaxel.Our data suggest that EGFR expression and KRAS mutation status is predictive for clinical response to matuzumab +/- paclitaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC.Phase I study of epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine plus matuzumab in previously untreated patients with advanced oesophagogastric cancer.To evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the humanised antiepidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody matuzumab combined with epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine (ECX) in patients as first-line treatment for advanced oesophagogastric cancer that express epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Therefore, these first successes led to the development of several drugs including monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab, panitumumab, matuzumab), TK inhibitors targeting one receptor as well as TK pan-inhibitors (lapatinib, HKI 272, PKI 166, EKB-569, AEE-788), currently assessed through clinical trials worldwide.Antibodies to the epidermal growth factor receptor in non small cell lung cancer: current status of matuzumab and panitumumab.Matuzumab and panitumumab are antibodies against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that are being evaluated in several malignancies including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In phase I trials of single-agent matuzumab in patients with EGFR-positive cancer, three tumor responses were documented in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma as well as colorectal carcinoma.A phase II trial of EMD72000 (matuzumab), a humanized anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian and primary peritoneal malignancies.CONCLUSIONS: Matuzumab at the dose and schedule selected is well tolerated. In this population of very heavily pretreated patients with epithelial ovarian and primary peritoneal malignancies, there was no evidence of significant clinical activity when matuzumab was administered as monotherapy.Phase I study of the humanised anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody matuzumab (EMD 72000) combined with gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer. Three groups of chemotherapy-naive advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients (n=17) received escalating doses of matuzumab (400 mg weekly, 800 mg biweekly, or 800 mg weekly) and gemcitabine (1000 mg m-2 weekly in weeks 1-3 of each 4-week cycle). A phase I study of the humanized monoclonal anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody EMD 72000 (matuzumab) in combination with paclitaxel in patients with EGFR-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).This phase I study assessed the tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the combination of matuzumab and paclitaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC.Other anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (panitunumab, matuzumab) are currently evaluated. It is the target for a class of agents at the forefront of development for the treatment of colorectal cancer, ie, the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, which include cetuximab, panitumumab, and matuzumab. Two other monoclonal antibodies, matuzumab (EMD 72000) and panitumumab (ABG-EGF), also have shown activity against EGFR-expressing CRC but are still in the early stage of clinical development.Matuzumab is currently undergoing phase II clinical trials for gastric, cervical, pancreatic and ovarian cancers.\"}, {\"question\": \"Which are the synonyms of prostate-specific antigen?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a 33 kDa single chain glycoprotein belonging to the kallikrein family of serine proteases which is produced by epithelial cells of both normal and malignant prostate tissue.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and predisposes to the development of hyperplastic or neoplastic changes in the parathyroid and pituitary glands and the endocrine pancreas, along with numerous other characteristic tumors and features. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the combined occurrence of parathyroid and adrenocortical tumors, and neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the pancreas and pituitary. The pancreatic NETs are predominantly gastrinomas and insulinomas, and the pituitary NETs are mostly prolactinomas and somatotrophinomas. We address the potential role of miRNAs in the endocrine pancreas, the pituitary gland, and the parathyroid glands-areas where MEN 1 shows high penetrance. Moreover, studies have provided evidence that dysregulation of miRNAs was responsible for endocrine carcinogenesis, including pancreatic, pituitary, and parathyroid tumors.MEN1 and MEN2 are rare inherited cancer syndromes which express a variety of endocrine and nonendocrine tumors.Multiple endocrine neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1) is a rare hereditary tumor syndrome predisposing to tumor development in several endocrine organs. Its major manifestations include hyperparathyroidism, tumors of endocrine pancreas and pituitary. eside these three, several other endocrine (adrenocortical, foregut carcinoid) and nonendocrine (lipoma, angiofibroma, collagenoma, ependymoma, meningioma) tumors have been described to be associated with this syndromeBoth familial and sporadic forms of the disease are known. The diagnosis of MEN1 can be established if two of the three major manifestations are found in the same patient, whereas the diagnosis of familial MEN1 requires one MEN1 patient and a first degree relative with at least one MEN1 manifestation. Both benign (parathyroid, anterior pituitary) and malignant (gastrinoma, glucagonoma) lesions may develop in MEN1 patientsMultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a classic hereditary tumor syndrome characterized by a genetic predisposition to develop a variety of neuroendocrine neoplasias and hormone excess syndromes.Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is a familial syndrome characterized by parathyroid, enteropancreatic and pituitary tumors. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an autosomal dominant inherited tumor syndrome characterized by the development of multiple endocrine tumorsMultiple facial angiofibromas were observed in 28 (88%) of the patients with MEN1, with 16 patients (50%) having 5 or more. Angiofibromas were clinically and histologically identical to those in individuals with tuberous sclerosis. Collagenomas were observed in 23 patients (72%). Also observed were cafe au lait macules in 12 patients (38%), lipomas in 11 patients (34%), confetti-like hypopigmented macules in 2 patients (6%), and multiple gingival papules in 2 patients (6%)Multiple angiofibromas, collagenomas, lipomas, confetti-like hypopigmented macules and multiple gingival papules are cutaneous manifestations of MEN1 and should be looked for in both family members of patients with MEN1 and individuals with hyperparathyroidism of other MEN1-associated tumors. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by nodular proliferation of the parathyroid glands and tumors of the anterior pituitary gland, the endocrine pancreas, and the neuroendocrine cell system of the gut.We report here a genetic study of a female MEN1 patient with the association of nodular hyperplasia of two parathyroid glands, an insulinoma, multiple duodenal gastrinomas, a prolactinoma, and a gastric carcinoid.Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is defined clinically by the combined occurrence of multiple tumors, typically of the parathyroid glands, pancreatic islet cells, and anterior pituitary gland.In support of previous findings in islet tumors, we found down-regulation of the cell-cycle regulator, p18, in both the pancreatic islet and pituitary adenomas, suggesting that reduced p18 levels may be important for Men1-related tumorigenesis in multiple tissues. Surprisingly, we identified increased p16 transcript in pancreatic islet and pituitary tumors.  The patient was studied and diagnosed with a multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN I), familiar (mother with MEN I). A scintigraphic study with 99mTc-MIBI was performed in order to localize hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands because of biochemical diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. The tumor was removed and histologically confirmed as a carcinoid within a thymus in a MEN type I syndrome. MEN I patients can benefit from the examination with this agent which can potentially localize not only parathyroid endocrine pathology but also unknown associated tumors.Pancreatic endocrine tumors occur sporadically and as part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndromes. We have analyzed 22 nonfamilial and 16 MEN 1-associated pancreatic endocrine tumors for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 3p, 11q13, and 18q. LOH at 3p was revealed in 45% and 36% of tumors from 31 patients with nonfamilial and MEN 1-associated disease, respectively.The data indicate involvement of tumor suppressor genes on 3p and 18q, in addition to the MEN1 gene at 11q13, in the tumorigenesis of both nonfamilial and MEN 1-associated pancreatic endocrine tumors.Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is characterized by the development of endocrine tumors of the parathyroid and pituitary glands, pancreas, and duodenum. Less frequently occurring tumors associated with MEN1 include non-endocrine tumors such as lipomas and angiofibromas. An increased incidence of thyroid neoplasms, leiomyomas, adrenal cortical hyperplasia, hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia, and renal angiomyolipoma has been noted in the MEN1 population. A germline mutation of the MEN1 gene was detected, and deletions of the MEN1 gene were consistently detected in multiple neuroendocrine tumors involving the parathyroid glands and the pancreas and a hepatic neuroendocrine tumor metastasis, as predicted by Knudson's \\\"two hit\\\" hypothesis.Two hits of the MEN1 gene were also detected in esophageal leiomyoma tissue, suggesting that tumorigenesis was directly related to the patient's underlying MEN1. In contrast, follicular thyroid adenoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia, and adrenal cortical hyperplasia consistently showed retained heterozygosity of the MEN1 gene with flanking markers and an intragenic marker. Therefore, these tumors appear to develop along pathogenetic pathways that are different from classical MEN1-associated tumors.Twelve unrelated (German MEN1 families and their associated tumors (5 parathyroid tumors, 1 vipoma, 1 gastrinoma, 1 insulinoma) were characterized for MEN1 gene mutations by single-strand conformational variant (SSCV) analysis and DNA sequence analysis as well as for loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 11q13. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) consists of benign, and sometimes malignant, tumors (often multiple in a tissue) of the parathyroids, enteropancreatic neuroendocrine system, anterior pituitary, and other tissues. Skin angiofibromas and skin collagenomas are common. \"}, {\"question\": \"Which are the different homologs or family members of the hedgehog proteins in mammals?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Hedgehog (Hh) signaling proteins stimulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue patterning at multiple points in animal development.

We report here biochemical and x-ray structural studies of Sonic, Indian, and Desert Hh proteins both alone and complexed with active domains of CDO and BOC.Previous work has shown that activin, a TGF(beta+) signaling molecule, permits pancreas development by repressing expression of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), a member of the hedgehog family of signaling molecules that antagonize pancreas development. Here we show that Indian hedgehog (Ihh), another hedgehog family member, and Patched 1 (Ptc1), a receptor and negative regulator of hedgehog activity, are expressed in pancreatic tissue.The original hedgehog (hh) gene was found in Drosophila and named for the appearance of a mutant phenotype which causes an embryo to be covered with pointy denticles, thus resembling a hedgehog. The hedgehog family consists of sonic hedgehog (Shh), desert hedgehog (Dhh), and Indian hedgehog (Ihh). Indian hedgehog (IHH) is a secreted signaling molecule of the hedgehog family known to play important roles in the regulation of chondrocyte differentiation, cortical bone formation, and the development of joints.Hedgehog (Hh) plays a pivotal role in various tissues during embryonic development, tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis. In mammals, Hh exists in three homologs: Desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh).Sonic hedgehog (SHH), Desert hedgehog (DHH) and Indian hedgehog (IHH) bind to Patched family receptors (PTCH1 and PTCH2) to transduce signals to GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3. GLI family transcription factors then activate transcription of Hedgehog target genes, such as FOXE1 and FOXM1 encoding Forkhead-box transcription factors.Indian hedgehog (IHH) and its receptors patched (PTC) and smoothened (SMO) belong to the hedgehog family of signaling molecules, which are essential for a variety of patterning events during mammalian tIssue development.In mammals, Hh exists in three homologs: Desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh).In mammals, Hh exists in three homologs: Desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh).A single Hh homolog is present in Drosophila, but three Hh homologs, Sonic Hh, Indian Hh, and Desert Hh, are present in mammals.A single Hh homolog is present in Drosophila, but three Hh homologs, Sonic Hh, Indian Hh, and Desert Hh, are present in mammalsIn mammals, Hh exists in three homologs: Desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh)\"}, {\"question\": \"Which scales are recommended by the American Heart Association for depression screening in cardiovascular patients? \", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) are recommended by the American Heart Association for depression screening in cardiovascular patients.\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"patient health questionnaire-2\"], [\"patient health questionnaire-9\"]], \"context\": \"In 2008, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommended a 2-step screening method, consisting of the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) followed by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), for identifying depression in cardiovascular patients.The American Heart Association (AHA) statement has recommended routine screening for depression in coronary artery disease with a 2-stage implementation of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ).A recent American Heart Association (AHA) Prevention Committee report recommended depression screening of all coronary heart disease patients using 2- and 9-item instruments from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2 and PHQ-9) to identify patients who may need further assessment and treatment.Patients were screened for depression using a protocol identical to the one endorsed by the AHA in a cardiology community clinic in Elmhurst (Queens, New York).

We first discovered that abnormal myelin hypercitrullination, even in normal-appearing white matter, by peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) correlates strongly with disease severity and might have an important role in MS progression. recent advances have shown that the once obscure modification known as citrullination is involved in the onset and progression of inflammatory diseases and cancer.These observations may reflect a role of P. gingivalis in the protein citrullination, which is related to the pathogenesis of RA.Protein citrullination has been detected in the CNS and associated with a number of neurological diseases.Protein and peptide citrullination are important in the development of rheumatoid arthritiscitrullination has been shown to be associated with several diseases, such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease.

OBJECTIVE Tol is a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for in vivo amyloid imaging. The ability to classify amyloid scans in a binary manner as 'normal' versus 'Alzheimer-like', is of high clinical relevance. We evaluated whether a supervised machine learning technique, support vector machines (SVM), can replicate the assignments made by visual readers blind to the clinical diagnosis, which image components have highest diagnostic value according to SVM and how (18)F-flutemetamol-based classification using SVM relates to structural MRI-based classification using SVM within the same subjects. By means of SVM with a linear kernel, we analyzed (18)F-flutemetamol scans and volumetric MRI scans from 72 cases from the (18)F-flutemetamol phase 2 study (27 clinically probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), 20 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 25 controls). In a leave-one-out approach, we trained the (18)F-flutemetamol based classifier by means of the visual reads and tested whether the classifier was able to reproduce the assignment based on visual reads and which voxels had the highest feature weights. The (18)F-flutemetamol based classifier was able to replicate the assignments obtained by visual reads with 100% accuracy. The voxels with highest feature weights were in the striatum, precuneus, cingulate and middle frontal gyrus. Second, to determine concordance between the gray matter volume- and the (18)F-flutemetamol-based classification, we trained the classifier with the clinical diagnosis as gold standard. Overall sensitivity of the (18)F-flutemetamol- and the gray matter volume-based classifiers were identical (85.2%), albeit with discordant classification in three cases. Specificity of the (18)F-flutemetamol based classifier was 92% compared to 68% for MRI. In the MCI disease (AD) is defined histologically by the presence of extracellular \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex. The diagnosis of dementia, along with the prediction of who will develop dementia, has been assisted by magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) by using [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). These techniques, however, are not specific for AD. Based on the chemistry of histologic staining dyes, several A\\u03b2-specific positron-emitting radiotracers have been developed to image neuropathology of AD. Among these, [(11)C]PiB is the most studied A\\u03b2-binding PET radiopharmaceutical in the world. The histologic and biochemical specificity of PiB binding across different regions of the AD brain was demonstrated by showing a direct correlation between A\\u03b2-containing amyloid plaques and in vivo [(11)C]PiB retention measured by PET imaging. Because (11)C is not ideal for commercialization, several (18)F-labeled tracers have been developed. At this time, [(18)F]3'-F-PiB (Flutemetamol), (18)F-AV-45 (Florbetapir), and (18)F-AV-1 (Florbetaben) are undergoing extensive phase II and III clinical trials. This article provides a brief review of the amyloid biology and chemistry of A\\u03b2-specific (11)C and (18)F-PET radiopharmaceuticals. Clinical trials have clearly documented that PET radiopharmaceuticals capable of assessing A\\u03b2 content in vivo in the brains of AD subjects and subjects with mild cognitive impairment will be important as diagnostic agents to detect in vivo amyloid brain pathology. In addition,is well known that many clinical and genetic factors have been associated with beta-amyloid deposition, few studies have examined the interactions of such factors across different stages of Alzheimer's pathogenesis. METHODS: We used 18F-florbetapir F18 PET imaging to quantify neuritic beta-amyloid plaque density across four cortical regions in 602 elderly (55-94 years) subjects from the national ADNI biomarker study. The group comprised of 194 normal elderly, 212 early mild cognitive impairment [EMCI], 132 late mild cognitive impairment [LMCI], and 64 mild Alzheimer's (AD). FINDINGS: In a model incorporating multiple predictive factors, the effect of apolipoprotein E \\u03b54 and diagnosis was significant on all four cortical regions. The highest signals were seen in cingulate followed by frontal and parietal with lowest signals in temporal lobe (p<0.0001). The effect of apolipoprotein E \\u03b54 (Cohen's D 0.96) on beta-amyloid plaque density was approximately twice as large as the effect of a diagnosis of AD (Cohen's D 0.51) and thrice as large as the effect of a diagnosis of LMCI (Cohen's D 0.34) (p<0.0001). Surprisingly, ApoE \\u03b54+ normal controls had greater mean plaque density across all cortical regions than \\u03b54- EMCI and \\u03b54- LMCI (p<0.0001, p=0.0009) and showed higher, though non-significant, mean value than \\u03b54- AD patients (p<0.27). ApoE \\u03b54+ EMCI and LMCI subjects had significantly greater mean plaque density across all cortical regions than \\u03b54- AD patients (p<0.027, p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Neuritic amyloid plaque load across progressive clinical stages of AD varies strongly by ApoE4 genotype.

Using these characteristics, as well as the presence of an N-terminal targeting sequence, a program was developed allowing prediction of integral membrane beta-barrel proteins encoded within any completely sequenced prokaryotic genome. This program, termed the beta-barrel finder (BBF) program, was used to analyze the proteins encoded within the Escherichia coli genome.A sequence-profile-based HMM for predicting and discriminating beta barrel membrane proteinsWe develop a HMM model, which can predict the topology of beta barrel membrane proteins using, as input, evolutionary information. The model is cyclic with 6 types of states: two for the beta strand transmembrane core, one for the beta strand cap on either side of the membrane, one for the inner loop, one for the outer loop and one for the globular domain state in the middle of each loop. The development of a specific input for HMM based on multiple sequence alignment is novel.Prediction of the transmembrane regions of beta-barrel membrane proteins with a neural network-based predictorA method based on neural networks is trained and tested on a nonredundant set of beta-barrel membrane proteins known at atomic resolution with a jackknife procedure.

Based on physical principles, our method can predict structures of the TM domain of \\u03b2-barrel membrane proteins of novel topology, including those from eukaryotic mitochondria. Our method is based on a model of physical interactions, a discrete conformational state space, an empirical potential function, as well as a model to account for interstrand loop entropy.exposure status classification of transmembrane beta barrel residuesSeveral computational methods exist for the identification of transmembrane beta barrel proteins (TMBs) from sequence. Some of these methods also provide the transmembrane (TM) boundaries of the putative TMBs.

The algorithm transFold employs a generalized hidden Markov model (i.e., multitape S-attribute grammar) to describe potential beta-barrel supersecondary structures and then computes by dynamic programming the minimum free energy beta-barrel structure.Predicting the solvent accessibility of transmembrane residues from protein sequenceIn this study, we propose a novel method to predict the solvent accessible surface areas of transmembrane residues. For both transmembrane alpha-helix and beta-barrel residues, the correlation coefficients between the predicted and observed accessible surface areas are around 0.65.BOMP: a program to predict integral beta-barrel outer membrane proteins encoded within genomes of Gram-negative bacteriaThis work describes the development of a program that predicts whether or not a polypeptide sequence from a Gram-negative bacterium is an integral beta-barrel outer membrane protein. The program, called the beta-barrel Outer Membrane protein Predictor (BOMP), is based on two separate components to recognize integral beta-barrel proteins. The first component is a C-terminal pattern typical of many integral beta-barrel proteins. The second component calculates an integral beta-barrel score of the sequence based on the extent to which the sequence contains stretches of amino acids typical of transmembrane beta-strands.A HMM-based method to predict the transmembrane regions of beta-barrel membrane proteinsA novel method is developed to model and predict the transmembrane regions of beta-barrel membrane proteins.

The specificity and sensitivity of 11 methods were separately evaluated. Our critical assessment shows that some secondary structure prediction methods (PHD, Dsc, Sopma) originally designed to predict globular protein structure are useful on porin topology prediction. The overall best prediction is obtained by combining these three \\\"generalist\\\" methods with a transmembrane beta strand prediction techniqueA knowledge-based potential highlights unique features of membrane \\u03b1-helical and \\u03b2-barrel protein insertion and foldingIn previous work, a depth-dependent insertion potential, E(z) , was derived for \\u03b1-helical inner membrane proteins. We have generated an equivalent potential for TM \\u03b2-barrel proteins. The similarities and differences between these two potentials provide insight into unique aspects of the folding and insertion of \\u03b2-barrel membrane proteins.

In addition, we have found that extended and contiguous weakly stable regions often signal the existence of an oligomer and that strands located in the interfaces of protein-protein interactions are considerably less stable. Based on these observations, we can predict oligomerization states and can identify the interfaces of protein-protein interactions for beta-barrel membrane proteins by using either structure or sequence informationRecently, we developed two top-performing methods based on machine-learning approaches to tackle both the detection of TMBBs in sets of proteins and the prediction of their topology.We introduce a graph-theoretic model for predicting the supersecondary structure of transmembrane \\u03b2-barrel proteins--a particular class of proteins that performs diverse important functions but it is difficult to determine their structure with experimental methods.Several computational methods have been developed to discriminate TMBBs from other types of proteins.To conquer this limitation, we developed a new computational model that can be used for predicting the ASA of both TM \\u03b1-helix and \\u03b2-barrel residues.Transmembrane beta barrel (TMB) proteins are found in the outer membranes of bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts.RESULTS: We present here, an HMM that combine a transmembrane barrel submodel and an SP submodel for both topology and SP predictions.Prediction of membrane spanning segments in beta-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMP) and their topology is an important problem in structural and functional genomics.In the simplest of these, the target \\\"model\\\" is another protein sequence, while the more elaborate methods group together the entire set of t ansmembrane helical or transmembrane beta-barrel proteins.Based on this study, we have developed a Web server, TBBPred, for predicting transmembrane beta-barrel regions in proteins (available at http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/tbbpred).\"}, {\"question\": \"How is active neurotoxin of Clostridium botulinum detected?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Active neurotoxin of Clostridium botulinum can be detected by:\\nmouse lethality assay\\nby mass spectrometry\\nbioassay\\ndifferentiated cell models\\npeptide cleavage assay\\nFDC (functional dual coating) microtitre plate immuno-biochemical assay\\nendopeptidase activity monitored via UV-Visible spectroscopy\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"mouse lethality assay\"], [\"by mass spectrometry\"], [\"bioassay\"], [\"differentiated cell models\"], [\"peptide cleavage assay\"], [\"FDC (functional dual coating) microtitre plate immuno-biochemical assay\"], [\"endopeptidase activity monitored via UV-Visible spectroscopy\"]], \"context\": \"The neurotoxin detection is based on the mouse lethality assay. which could be shown by bioassay to produce biologically active type B toxin in culture.Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) hold great promise for providing various differentiated cell models for in vitro toxigenicity testing.

Subsequently, UvrA, UvrB and UvrC form the excinuclease protein UvrABC endonuclease, a multi-enzymatic complex which carries out repair of damaged DNA in sequential manner. In some cases, Cho may be the effective nuclease for NER, rather than UvrC. UvrC nuclease and the short oligonucleotide that contains the DNA lesion are removed from the post-incision complex by UvrD, a superfamily 1A helicase.

RESULTS: Inactivation of any of the four uvr genes strongly increased the susceptibility of H. pylori to DNA damage by ultraviolet light. Inactivation of uvrA and uvrB significantly decreased mutation frequencies whereas only the uvrA deficient mutant exhibited a significant decrease of the recombination frequency after natural transformation. A uvrC mutant did not show significant changes in mutation or recombination rates; however, inactivation of uvrC promoted the incorporation of significantly longer fragments of donor DNA (2.2-fold increase) into the recipient chromosome. A deletion of uvrD induced a hyper-recombinational phenotype.Transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR) is a subpathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER) that is triggered when RNA polymerase is stalled by DNA damage.

LMO2-C can bind endogenous GATA1 and LDB1 protein in K562 cells and down regulates the expression of GPA.We identify novel transcription factor binding partners for PIAS3 including ETS, EGR1, NR1I2, and GATA1.At other differentiation stages, additional combinatorial interactions occurred between RUNX1 and its coregulators, GATA1 and ETS. Ldb1, a ubiquitously expressed LIM domain binding protein, is essential in a number of tissues during development. It interacts with Gata1, Tal1, E2A and Lmo2 to form a transcription factor complex regulating late erythroid genes. Using a biotinylation tagging/proteomics approach in erythroid cells, we describe distinct GATA-1 interactions with the essential hematopoietic factor Gfi-1b, the repressive MeCP1 complex and the chromatin remodeling ACF/WCRF complex, in addition to the known GATA-1/FOG-1 and GATA-1/TAL-1 complexes. Importantly, we show that FOG-1 mediates GATA-1 interactions with the MeCP1 complex, thus providing an explanation for the overlapping functions of these two factors in erythropoiesis.Here we show that Ski interacts with GATA1, a transcription factor essential in erythropoiesis. Using a Ski mutant deficient in GATA1 binding, we show that this Ski-GATA1 interaction is critical for Ski's ability to repress GATA1-mediated transcription and block erythroid differentiation. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1. tudies involving point mutants of GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another. \"}, {\"question\": \"What histone variants play a role in the DNA damage reponse?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Mostly H2A.X, but H2A.Z and H1R have also been associated to DNA damage\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"H2A.X\"], [\"H2A.Z\"], [\"H1R\"]], \"context\": \"H2A.Z is an evolutionarily ancient and highly conserved H2A variant that regulates processes ranging from gene expression to the DNA damage responseactivation of DNA damage checkpoints (ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and H2A histone family, member X (H2AFX (H2AFX)))the specialization imparted by histone H2A (H2A.X and H2A.Z) variants to the nucleosome core particle constitutes the earliest response to DNA damage in the cellhistone variants (H2AX and H2A.Z), histone post-translational modifications (acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation and ubiquitination) and chromatin-remodeling complexes (INO80, SWR1, SWI/SNF, RSC and NuRD) are important and direct players in the DNA double-strand break (DSB)H2A.Z incorporation in the coding regions of genes encoding proteins involved in the regulation of meiosis and genotoxic stress responses phosphorylation of H2AX, a DNA damage signalDSB) are generally considered the most critical lesion induced by ionizing radiation (IRphosphorylated forms of histone H2AX H2AX has a complete SQ(E/D)varphi (where varphi denotes a hydrophobic residue) known to be phosphorylated in response to DNA damageH2A.X, plays a very important role in the cellular response to DNA damageH2A.X is an H2A variant present in multicellular organisms that is specifically phosphorylated on the serine in the C-terminal consensus sequence, canonically \\\"SQEY,\\\" in response to DNA damage.H2AFX) is important in maintaining chromatin structure and genetic stabilitySaccharomyces cerevisiae, the linker histone HHO1 is involved in DNA repairH1 variant, H1R is involved in DNA damage responsehigh levels of histone H2AX phosphorylation and an increased incorporation of the Htz1p histone variant into chromatin surrounding the DSBTRF2 upregulation was more dramatic in drug-resistant cells and occurred before the expression of ATM, gammaH2AX and p53DNA double-strand breaks induced by anticancer drugs or irradiation increase TRF2 expressionHistone variant H2AX and core histone H2A are phosphorylated in mammals and budding yeast, respectively.

Excellent intraindividual correlations were demonstrated between breath ammonia and BUN (0.86 to 0.96), which demonstrates the possibility of using low cost point of care breath ammonia systems as a noninvasive means of monitoring kidney dysfunction and treatment.Recently, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) has emerged as an important biomarker for the assessment and management of asthma.Here we discuss the potential of adapting a technology from the electronics industry, surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors, for diagnosis of multiple markers of sepsis in real time, using non-invasive assays of exhaled breath condensate. Together these data indicate that FeNO testing has an important role in the assessment and management of adult asthma. Measurement of acetone in human breath samples has been previously shown to provide significant non-invasive diagnostic insight into the control of a patient's diabetic condition.  Urea breath testing may provide a useful diagnostic and biomarker assay for tuberculosis and treatment response.These animal model results suggest that exhaled breath can be used as a point-of-care tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of sepsis.Point-of-care breath test for biomarkers of active pulmonary tuberculosis.RATIONALE: Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath provide biomarkers of tuberculosis (TB) because Mycobacterium tuberculosis manufactures VOC metabolites that are detectable in the breath of infected patients. CONCLUSIONS: A six-minute point-of-care breath test for volatile biomarkers accurately identified subjects with active pulmonary TB.Selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) can measure volatile compounds in breath on-line in real time and has the potential to provide accurate breath tests for a number of inflammatory, infectious and metabolic diseases, including diabetes.Breath analysis by SIFT-MS offers a rapid, reproducible and easily performed measurement of acetone concentration in ambulatory patients with type 2 diabetes. IGR is a new approach for non-invasive cardiac output measurement in mechanically ventilated individuals, but requires further investigation for clinical use.The liver metabolic breath test relies on measuring exhaled (13) C tagged methacetin, which is metabolized only by the liver.

A high percentage of patients with different severities of asthma and regardless of their treatment with ICS and current smoking habit (current and/or ex-smokers) had highly elevated FE(NO) values, suggesting that their current therapy was possibly insufficient to control the underlying degree of airway inflammation and asthma symptoms.H. pylori-positive status was defined by positivity on at least 2 tests: a commercial H. pylori stool antigen enzyme immunoassay, an immunoglobulin G antibody enzyme immunoassay, and the C-urea breath testEnd-tidal carbon dioxide measurements in children with acute asthma.CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive bedside measurement of EtCO2 values among children with acute asthma is feasible. Review article: the assessment of liver function using breath tests.The recent development of a real-time, point-of-care liver function breath test has made it straightforward to assess the metabolic function of the liver.RESULTS: The (13)C-methacetin breath test enables accurate follow-up of patients with acute or chronic liver damage, where overall hepatic function is significantly suppressed by known causes of liver disorders, including acute, sub-acute or chronic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Breath testing that provides continuous quantification of methacetin metabolism may be a sensitive tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with liver disorders. A multi-center study in a multi-ethnic population compared the RAPIRUN urine antibody test with the (13)C-urea breath test (C-UBT) and a traditional serologic test, the high-molecular-weight cell-associated protein enzyme immunoassay (HM-CAP EIA). CONCLUSION: EGA provided non-invasive, accurate, continuous, high-resolution COHb% measurements. Applying EGA to carboxyhaemoglobin dilution, we achieved RCV measurements with accuracy equivalent to that of CO-haemoximetry, with one-fifth of the COB infusion volume.

Alteplase appears to show efficacy for treatment of thrombus-related venous catheter occlusion in pediatric patients; however, data regarding its use in occluded dialysis catheters are limited.The trials used to support Food and Drug Administration approval of alteplase for central venous catheter (CVC) occlusions generally had low pediatric enrollment; however, additional small studies are available that support use of alteplase for this indication in children.To review the literature pertaining to the efficacy of alteplase for restoration of patency of occluded venous and dialysis catheters in pediatric patients. Intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue Plasminogen Activator improves outcomes in patients treated early after stroke but at the risk of causing intracranial hemorrhage.Intravenous alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) is the only approved thrombolytic agent at present indicated for acute ischaemic stoke.This paper presents a summary of the evidence review group report into the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alteplase for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke, in accordance with the licensed indication, based upon the evidence submission from the manufacturer to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) as part of the single technology appraisal (STA) process. The submitted clinical evidence included several randomised controlled trials indicating that, in highly selected patients, alteplase administered at a licensed dose within 3 hours of the onset of acute ischaemic stroke is associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of death or dependency at 3 months compared with placebo, despite a significantly increased risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within the first 7-10 days. Data from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) trial suggest that the benefit of treatment is sustained at 6 and 12 months.The guidance issued by NICE in April 2007 as a result of the STA states that alteplase is recommended for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke only when used by physicians trained and experienced in the management of acute stroke and in centres with the required facilities.Because of the risk of hemorrhage, especially in the brain, thrombolytic therapy with intravenous alteplase is restricted by guidelines, and only a small number of selected patients are being treated.Alteplase can be given to patients with cervical artery dissection, seizure at onset and evidence of acute ischemia on brain imaging, and after carefully weighing risk and benefit in pregnancy and during menstruation. Alteplase is the first thrombolytic drug to be approved in France for the treatment of ischaemic stroke within three hours of symptom onset.However, the Cochrane systematic review of thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke suggests that alteplase is the most promising treatment for acute ischaemic stroke.  To determine whether cryopreserved solutions of the thrombolytic agent alteplase could be used as a safe, effective, and economically reasonable alternative to urokinase in patients presenting with occluded central venous access devices (CVADs).Alteplase has been reported as an efficacious alternative to urokinase for treatment of occluded CVADs. Patients presenting with occluded CVADs received a sufficient volume of the thawed alteplase solution to fill the occluded catheter(s). Cryopreserved 1-mg/mL aliquots of alteplase are safe and effective in the clearance of occluded CVADs when stored at -20 degrees C for 30 days. The ability to cryopreserve alteplase aliquots makes it an economically reasonable alternative to urokinase in the setting of CVAD occlusion.Of the thrombolytic agents and therapeutic protocols in use, alteplase 100 mg/2 hours seems to be the best compromise between the risk of bleeding and efficacy in reducing pulmonary resistances by 30 to 40% and relatively early pulmonary revascularisation of 40-50%. To explore the best regimen of treatment for acute pulmonary embolism(APE), and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2-h infusion of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, Alteplase (rt-PA) and urokinase(UK). A 2 h regimen of rt-PA or UK showed reliable efficacy and safety for treatment of APE. The indication of thrombolytic therapy can be extended.Tissue type plasminogen activator is available, through recombinant technology, for thrombolytic use as alteplase.Alteplase has been used successfully in evolving myocardial infarction (MI) to reopen occluded coronary arteries. Alteplase is most effective when given early in MI and is probably ineffective when given 12 h after the onset of symptoms. The effectiveness of alteplase in MI can be increased by front loading with a bolus of 15 mg, followed by an infusion of 50 mg over 30 min and 35 mg over 60 min.A reduced dose of alteplase to increase coronary artery patency prior to angioplasty may be useful in MI. An exciting new indication for the use of alteplase is in stroke, where it has become the first beneficial intervention. Alteplase is used to reopen occluded cerebral vessels but is associated with an increased risk of intracerebral haemorrhage. Alteplase is beneficial if given within 3 h of the onset of stroke but not after this time period.Clinical trials have not established a role for alteplase in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes or deep vein thrombosis. However, alteplase is useful in treating pulmonary thromboembolism and peripheral vascular disease.Our aim was to design and evaluate a new and easily administered recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) regimen for thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) based on established pharmacokinetic data that improve the reperfusion success rate. Rapid restoration of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow is a primary predictor of mortality after thrombolysis in AMI.The 60-min alteplase thrombolysis in AMI protocol achieved a TIMI grade 3 patency rate of 81.1% at 90 min with no indication of an increased bleeding hazard; it was associated with a 1.2% overall mortality rate.Alteplase is now firmly established as a treatment of choice in the management of acute myocardial infarction. The efficacy of intravenous alteplase in the treatment of pulmonary thromboembolism has also been established and appears to be similar to that of streptokinase and urokinase in this indication and in arterial thrombotic occlusion. However, its use in this latter indication and in other vascular disorders has not been as extensively documented. Although trials demonstrating the efficacy of intravenous alteplase in patients with deep vein thrombosis and intra-arterial alteplase in patients with arterial thrombotic occlusion exist, reliable data on the efficacy of the fibrinolytic in ischaemic stroke and intracranial haemorrhage are scarce.Further, preliminary data suggest efficacy in the therapy of deep vein thrombosis and arterial thrombotic occlusion, and alteplase has a proven place in the fibrinolytic treatment of pulmonary thromboembolism.The non-antigenic competitor for these two compounds for the indication of MI is alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, rt-PA). In the framework of tailored thrombolytic therapy, alteplase or urokinase appear to be the drugs of choice in these patients.Patients with a recent (less than 10 days) proximal deep vein thrombosis of the leg or pelvis are candidates for thrombolysis as the major benefit over heparin seems to be the prevention of the postphlebitic limb, an aim which is still not proven in a satisfactory manner. Nonocclusive thrombi appear to lyse more readily than occlusive thrombi. For this indication the optimal dose regimens for the three thrombolytic drugs (streptokinase, urokinase, alteplase) are not established. To save 1 year of life, the costs of thrombolytic therapy using intravenous streptokinase, alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator; rt-PA) or anistreplase (anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex) under standard restricted indication criteria, vary from 1000 pounds British sterling to 1700 pounds British sterling in the UK, SEK3090 to 9660 in Scandinavia and $US35 000 to 800 000 in the US, depending on time delay in starting treatment after pain onset, size of infarct, thrombolytic agents used, study methodology, lists of clinical events considered in cost counting and the discount rate.Thus, the results of the ETTT trial show that the used low dosages of alteplase administered intravenously over 3-7 days in heparinized patients cannot be recommended as a treatment for patients with deep venous thrombosis of lower limbs and/or pelvis. Further studies are needed to define a more suitable dosage regimen of alteplase in this indication.Streptokinase, urokinase and alteplase have all been shown to accelerate the lysis of pulmonary emboli and to decrease pulmonary vascular obstruction and pulmonary hypertension. The local treatment of acute arterial occlusion in limb arteries results in rapid clearing of the artery in 67% of patients treated with streptokinase; the corresponding success rates for urokinase and alteplase are 81% and 88 to 94%, respectively. More recently, new drugs like alteplase, reteplase, lanoteplase and saruplase have been a breakthrough in the treatment of acute myocardial infarctionThe non-antigenic competitor for these two compounds for the indication of MI is alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, rt-PA)The trials used to support Food and Drug Administration approval of alteplase for central venous catheter (CVC) occlusions generally had low pediatric enrollment; however, additional small studies are available that support use of alteplase for this indication in childrenSome acute ischemic strokes (before the 3rd hour) could be treated with alteplase if there is no absolute or relative contraindication for thrombolysis.Alteplase and reteplase are the most efficient thrombolytics despite a higher risk of cerebral bleeding. \"}, {\"question\": \"List scaffold proteins of the ERK signaling pathway.\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Originally identified in yeast, scaffold proteins are now recognized to contribute to the specificity of MEK/ERK pathways in mammalian cells.

Using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human aorta cDNA library, we identified mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-responsive kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)2, a member of the ERK cascade, as an hDlg binding partner.Taken together, these findings allow us to hypothesize that hDlg acts as a MEK2-specific scaffold protein for the ERK signaling pathway, and may improve our understanding of how scaffold proteins, such as hDlg, differentially tune MEK1/MEK2 signaling and cell responses.Here, we show that two scaffold proteins, caveolin-1 and IQGAP1, are required for phosphorylation of the actin associated pool of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in response to protein kinase C activation.ERK activation is enhanced by the scaffolding proteins KSR and MP1, localized near the cell membrane and late endosomes respectively, but little is known about their dynamic interplay. Originally identified in yeast, scaffold proteins are now recognized to contribute to the specificity of MEK/ERK pathways in mammalian cells.

This demonstrates that KSR is a bona fide scaffold that is not required for but enhances signaling via the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway.We reported previously that several 14-3-3 isotypes bind to protein kinase C (PKC)-zeta and facilitate coupling of PKC-zeta to Raf-1 [van der Hoeven, van der Wal, Ruurs, van Dijk and van Blitterswijk (2000) Biochem.

The scaffold protein IQGAP1 regulates cell signaling through the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway.Kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) is a molecular scaffold that interacts with the components of the Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade and positively regulates ERK signaling.Our results indicate that KSR-2 may act as a scaffold protein similar as KSR-1 to mediate the MAPK core (RAF-MEK-ERK) signaling but with a distinct RAF isoform specificity, namely KSR-2 may only mediate the A-RAF signaling while KSR-1 is responsible for transducing signals only from c-RAF.Kinase Suppressor of Ras (KSR) is a molecular scaffold that interacts with the core kinase components of the ERK cascade, Raf, MEK, ERK to provide spatial and temporal regulation of Ras-dependent ERK cascade signaling.These findings identify KSR2 as a Ca2+-regulated ERK scaffold and reveal a new mechanism whereby Ca2+ impacts Ras to ERK pathway signaling.MEK Partner-1 (MP1) was identified as a potential \\\"scaffold\\\" protein for the mammalian extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathwayThe scaffold protein MP1 (MEK1 partner) assembles a scaffold complex in the ERK cascadeIQGAP1 scaffold-MAP kinase (ERK) interaction was noted in the human myeloma RPMI8226 cell lines.

The maintenance function of Dnmt1 is regulated by its large regulatory N-terminal domain that interacts with other chromatin factors and is essential for the recognition of hemi-methylated DNA.In this study, we examined a role for the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B, in particular, the truncated isoform DNMT3B7, which is generated frequently in cancer.DNMT1 is a widely expressed DNA methyltransferase maintaining methylation patterns in development, and mediating transcriptional repression by direct binding to HDAC2.DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are a family of related proteins that both catalyze the de novo formation of 5-methylcytosine and maintain these methylation marks in cell-specific patterns in virtually all mitotic cells of the body.This methylation is critical for imprinting; a reduction in the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 causes a widespread loss of imprinting.DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) is the key methyltransferase in DNA methylation regulations.DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are a family of enzymes that methylate DNA at the C5 position of cytosine residues, and their inhibition is a promising strategy for the treatment of various developmental and proliferative diseases, particularly cancers.DNA methylation is mediated by a family of DNA methyltransferases.These results suggest that DNMT1 and DNMT3B regulate BAG-1 expression via insulator protein DNA-binding and chromatin dynamics by regulating histone dimethylation.Here we show that human miR-148 represses DNA methyltransferase 3b (Dnmt3b) gene expression through a region in its coding sequence.DNA methylation is catalyzed by a family of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) including the maintenance enzyme DNMT 1 and de novo methyltransferases DNMT 3a and DNMT 3b.Among the reported down-regulated miRNAs in lung cancer, the miRNA (miR)-29 family (29a, 29b, and 29c) has intriguing complementarities to the 3'-UTRs of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)3A and -3B (de novo methyltransferases), two key enzymes involved in DNA methylation, that are frequently up-regulated in lung cancer and associated with poor prognosis.Furthermore, we have examined the roles of the de novo methyltransferases (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) and related protein (Dnmt3L) in this process.DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) has been reported to interact with a wide variety of factors and to contain intrinsic transcriptional repressor activity.Inactivation of both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, DNA methyltransferases essential for the initiation of de novo DNA methylation, abolished the establishment of DNA methylation and the silencing of Rhox cluster genes in the embryo proper.Rather, in vitro analysis indicates that Dnmt3L stimulates DNA methylation by both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b through direct binding to these proteins.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in promoter of the DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) gene and risk for development and lymphatic metastasis of gastric cardiac adenocarcinoma (GCA).Methylation at the 5-position of DNA cytosine on the vertebrate genomes is accomplished by the combined catalytic actions of three DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), the de novo enzymes DNMT3A and DNMT3B and the maintenance enzyme DNMT1.There are two major categories of DNA methyltransferases: de novo and maintenance.Some, but not all, murine H1 subtypes interact with DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B.\"}, {\"question\": \"Which classes of endogenous retroelements are known to date?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Endogenous retroelements fall into two distinct classes: retrotransposons containing LTRs (Long Terminal Repeats), and retrostransposons lacking LTRs.\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"retrotransposons containing LTRs (Long Terminal Repeats)\"], [\"retrostransposons lacking LTRs (Long Terminal Repeats)\"]], \"context\": \"Transposons are divided into two general classes based on their transposition intermediate (DNA or RNA).

Eight patients (10.5%) had point mutations (R27H, E901K, G1743R (detected in three families), V728I, N1443S and E1152X).Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a life-threatening arrhythmia disorder associated with autosomal-dominant mutations in the SCN5A gene. We aimed to characterize the diagnostic challenges and clinical manifestations of a novel SCN5A mutation associated with BrS. RESULTS: From a novel SCN5A mutation (c.664C>T; p.Arg222X) identified in a proband with the characteristic electrocardiographic pattern and the history of sudden collapse, 122 family members were studied including 40 carriers of the mutation. We analyzed the sequence of this gene in 25 Spanish patients with Brugada syndrome. In 4 (16%), we found mutations that had not previously been described: three were amino acid changes (i.e. Ala2>Thr, Ala735>Thr and Val1340>Ile) and one was an intron mutation that affected messenger RNA processing (i.e. IVS18-1G>A).The 4 most frequent BrS1-associated mutations were E1784K (14x), F861WfsX90 (11x), D356N (8x), and G1408R (7x).One missense mutation (G400A) in SCN5A was detected in a conserved region among the cohort of 19 patients. A H558R polymorphism was detected on the same allele. Thus, we studied the functional restoration of nonsense-mutated SCN5A. RESULTS: HEK293 cells were transfected with SCN5A cDNA or its mutant carrying W822X, a nonsense mutation associated with Brugada syndrome and sudden cardiac death. Among the cohort of 19 patients, one missense mutation (G400A) in SCN5A was detected in a conserved region. An H558R polymorphism was detected on the same allele.Novel SCN5A mutation (Q55X) associated with age-dependent expression of Brugada syndrome presenting as neurally mediated syncope.A novel nonsense SCN5A mutation (Q55X) was identified in the proband, his mother, and his asymptomatic brother.Novel SCN5A gene mutations associated with Brugada syndrome: V95I, A1649V and delF1617An intronic mutation (c.4810+3_4810+6dupGGGT) in the SCN5A gene, located outside the consensus splice site, was detected in this study in a family with a highly variable clinical phenotype of Brugada syndrome and/or conduction disease and in a patient with Brugada syndrome.We genetically screened 30 asymptomatic probands (29 men and 1 woman; mean age 47.1 years) exhibiting a spontaneous Brugada-type ECG. Family members of patients with Brugada syndrome were excluded from the study. Genetic screening failed to identify SCN5A mutations in most cases but demonstrated a novel double missense mutation (K1527R and A1569P) located on the same allele in another asymptomatic subject (case 2).We screened patients with SUNDS for mutations in SCN5A, the gene known to cause Brugada syndrome, as well as genes encoding ion channels associated with the long-QT syndrome.One mutation, R367H, lies in the first P segment of the pore-lining region between the DIS5 and DIS6 transmembrane segments of SCN5A. A second mutation, A735V, lies in the first transmembrane segment of domain II (DIIS1) close to the first extracellular loop between DIIS1 and DIIS2, whereas the third mutation, R1192Q, lies in domain III.The substitution (D1790G) causes LQTS and the insertion (D1795) induces both LQTS and Brugada syndromes in carrier patients.\"}, {\"question\": \"List all articles on network meta-analysis for smoking cessation\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Cardiovascular events associated with smoking cessation pharmacotherapies: a network meta-analysis.\\nPharmacological interventions for smoking cessation: an overview and network meta-analysis\\nEffectiveness and cost-effectiveness of computer and other electronic aids for smoking cessation: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.\\nSmoking cessation interventions in COPD: a network meta-analysis of randomised trials.\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"Cardiovascular events associated with smoking cessation pharmacotherapies: a network meta-analysis.\"], [\"Pharmacological interventions for smoking cessation: an overview and network meta-analysis\"], [\"Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of computer and other electronic aids for smoking cessation: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.\"], [\"Smoking cessation interventions in COPD: a network meta-analysis of randomised trials.\"]], \"context\": \"Cardiovascular events associated with smoking cessation pharmacotherapies: a network meta-analysis.Pharmacological interventions for smoking cessation: an overview and network meta-analysis.Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of computer and other electronic aids for smoking cessation: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.network meta-analysis on interventions for smoking cessation including over 100 trialsSmoking cessation interventions in COPD: a network meta-analysis of randomised trials.\"}, {\"question\": \"Which are the most frequent syndromes associated with inherited bone marrow failure?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"The inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders that share the inability of the bone marrow to produce an adequate number of blood cells.

This microcell-mediated, chromosome-transfer construct harbors a centromeric segment and a neo-marked segment from the distal long arm of human chromosome 17.The cosmids in the NF1 region will be an important resource for testing DNA blots of large-fragment restriction-enzyme digests from NF1 patient cell lines, to detect rearrangements in patients' DNA and to identify the 17;22 NF1 translocation breakpoint.The frequent LOH surrounding the NF1 locus and lack of neurofibromin expression in these tumors suggest that NF1 gene mutations may contribute to the development of adrenal gland neoplasms in patients with NF1.In the latter, the breakpoint in 17q occurred below the centromere and is at or in the region of the Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) gene.Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant condition associated with mutations in the long arm of chromosome 17, and characterised by neurofibromas, caf\\u00e9-au-lait spots and axillary freckling.In addition, the mother's and maternal grandmother's genetic analysis showed identical mutations in the neurofibromatosis I gene on the long arm of chromosome 17, confirming the diagnosis of NF1.Duplicon-mediated microdeletions around the NF1 gene are frequently associated with a severe form of neurofibromatosis type I in a subgroup of patients who show an earlier onset of cutaneous neurofibromas, dysmorphic facial features, and lower IQ values.Neurofibromatosis had been diagnosed in infancy, and genetic testing showed that the patient had a mutation in chromosome 17, consistent with neurofibromatosis type I.Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common inherited diseases in humans. It is caused by a mutation in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17, and is associated with numerous central and peripheral nervous system manifestations.In 95% of NF1 individuals, a mutation is found in the NF1 gene, and in 5% of the patients, the germline mutation consists of a microdeletion that includes the NF1 gene and several flanking genes.Herein, we describe a unique case of anaplastic de novo astroblastoma-sarcoma, in essence a variant of gliosarcoma, occurring in a 50-year-old female with documented NF1.

Testing for abnormalities of chromosomes 7, 9, 10, 12, 17, 19 and 20, including the EGFR, p16, PTEN, MDM2 and NF1 gene regions, we found the tumor to exhibit a deletion of PTEN, monosomy 17 and gains of chromosomes 19 and 20q.Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting 1 in 3000 people. The NF1 gene is located on chromosome 17q11.2, spans 350 kb of genomic DNA, and contains 60 exons.A patient with recurrent-remittent multiple sclerosis associated with neurofibromatosis type I is described. The case is interesting for two reasons: 1) the difficulty of evaluating MRI findings, since both entities involve similar anomalies and 2) the relation between the two entities, according to evidence from recent genetic studies showing that the myelin protein gene associated to oligodendrocytes is part of an intron of the neurofibromatosis-1 gene of chromosome 17.Neurofibromatosis type I (NFI) is a common autosomal dominant disorder with an increased risk for developing benign and malignant tumors. The NFI gene has been cloned and maps to 17q11.2, and the gene product acts as a tumor suppressor gene.Direct sequencing of the NF1 gene in tumor DNA identified the presence of an inactivating NF1 somatic mutation in 41% (25/61) of analyzed sporadic tumors, associated with loss of the wild-type allele in 84% (21/25) of cases.A novel mutation c.4821delA was identified in NF1 gene, which predicted truncation of neurofibromin (p.Leu1607fs).She had a genotype of heterozygous c.6709C>T mutation of NF1 gene.RESULTS: The mutational analysis of the NF1 gene revealed a novel frameshift insertion mutation in exon 4c (c.654 ins A) in all affected family members.Using lymphoblastoid, fibroblast, and buccal cell samples collected from both twins and from other family members in three generations, we discovered a pathogenic nonsense mutation in exon 40 of the NF1 gene.We also found a novel non-synonymous change in exon 16 of the NF1 gene that was transmitted from the unaffected mother to both twins and co-segregated with the pathogenic mutation in the ensuing generation.The disease gene of the Chinese NF1 family was linked to NF1 locus, and a nonsense mutation, G1336X in the NF1 gene was identified.The present study demonstrated that G1336X mutation in the NF1 gene cause Neurofibromatosis type I in the family.\"}, {\"question\": \"Which genes does thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 regulate in the heart?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"\\u03b2-myosin heavy chain, alpha-myosin heavy chain, SR(Ca)ATPase, phospholamban, nucleotide-gated potassium channel 2, KCNE1, HCN2, HCN4, KCND2, KCND3, KCNA4\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"\\u03b2-myosin heavy chain\"], [\"alpha-myosin heavy chain\"], [\"SR(Ca)ATPase\"], [\"phospholamban\"], [\"nucleotide-gated potassium channel 2\"], [\"KCNE1\"], [\"HCN2\"], [\"HCN4\"], [\"KCND2\"], [\"KCND3\"], [\"KCNA4\"]], \"context\": \"A group of mice was treated with debutyl-dronedarone (DBD), a selective TR\\u03b11 inhibitor (AMI-DBD)Furthermore, AMI resulted in \\u03b2-myosin heavy chain overexpression and reduction in the ratio of SR(Ca)ATPase to phospholamban (PLB).

Here we recorded interpretable diffraction data from micrometer-sized lipidic sponge phase crystals of the Blastochloris viridis photosynthetic reaction center delivered into an X-FEL beamHere we show that high-quality diffraction data can be obtained with a single X-ray pulse from a non-crystalline biological sample, a single mimivirus particle, which was injected into the pulsed beam of a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source.Single mimivirus particles intercepted and imaged with an X-ray laserFemtosecond X-ray protein nanocrystallographyHere we present a method for structure determination where single-crystal X-ray diffraction 'snapshots' are collected from a fully hydrated stream of nanocrystals using femtosecond pulses from a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. We prove this concept with nanocrystals of photosystem I, one of the largest membrane protein complexes.These methods can be used to image biological and materials science samples at high resolution with x-ray undulator radiation and establishes the techniques to be used in atomic-resolution ultrafast imaging at x-ray free-electron laser sources.With the prospects of the x-ray free electron lasers, this approach could provide a major new opportunity for the high-resolution three-dimensional structure determination of single biomolecules.X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) generate sequences of ultra-short spatially coherent pulses of X-ray radiation.Diffractive imaging using the intense and coherent beam of X-ray free-electron lasers opens new perspectives for structural studies of single nanoparticles and biomolecules.The opening of hard X-ray free-electron laser facilities, such as the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in the United States, has ushered in a new era in structural determination.Where possible we also highlight areas that we think could push this field forward with emerging technologies, such as X-ray free electron lasers (X-feL), which could have a big impact on the membrane protein structural biology community.X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) deliver short (<100 fs) and intense (\\u223c10(12) photons) pulses of hard X-rays, making them excellent sources for time-resolved studies.Modern imaging techniques at the molecular scale rely on utilizing novel coherent light sources like X-ray free electron lasers for the ultimate goal of visualizing such objects as individual biomolecules rather than crystals.In single-particle coherent x-ray diffraction imaging experiments, performed at x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), samples are exposed to intense x-ray pulses to obtain single-shot diffraction patterns.The structure reveals the mechanism of native TbCatB inhibition and demonstrates that new biomolecular information can be obtained by the \\\"diffraction-before-destruction\\\" approach of x-ray free-electron lasers from hundreds of thousands of individual microcrystals.Coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) of single molecules at atomic resolution is a major goal for the x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs).Ultrashort X-ray pulses from free-electron laser X-ray sources make it feasible to conduct small- and wide-angle scattering experiments on biomolecular samples in solution at sub-picosecond timescales.The short and intense pulses of the new X-ray free electron lasers, now operational or under construction, may make possible diffraction experiments on single molecule-sized objects with high resolution, before radiation damage destroys the sample.The recent development of x-ray free electron lasers providing coherent, femtosecond-long pulses of high brilliance and variable energy opens new areas of scientific research in a variety of disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and biology.X-ray free electron laser (X-FEL)-based serial femtosecond crystallography is an emerging method with potential to rapidly advance the challenging field of membrane protein structural biology.X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) show promise for revealing the structure of single molecules or nanocrystals, but the phase problem remains largely unsolved.Coherent diffractive imaging using x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) may provide a unique opportunity for high-resolution structural analysis of single particles sprayed from an aqueous solution into the laser beam.Here we present a method for structure determination where single-crystal X-ray diffraction 'snapshots' are collected from a fully hydrated stream of nanocrystals using femtosecond pulses from a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source.This work is directly relevant to the time-resolved imaging of magnetic dynamics using coherent and ultrafast radiation from x-ray free-electron lasers and also to broader classes of diffractive imaging experiments which suffer noisy data, missing data, or both.By combining serial nanocrystallography with x-ray free-electron laser sources in the future, it may be possible to produce molecular-resolution electron-density maps using membrane protein crystals that contain only a few hundred or thousand unit cells.Very strong soft X-ray free electron laser (FEL) pulses must be short to allow for investigations of ultra-fast wet chemistry, according to the principle of collect and destroy.\"}, {\"question\": \"Which protein kinases have been found to phosphorylate Phospholamban and affect its biological activity?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Phosphorylation of phospholamban at Ser16 is mainly mediated by PKA and at Thr17 by Ca(2+) /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII).

We found that when activated, Akt interacts with and phosphorylates PLN at Thr(17), the Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent kinase IIdelta site, whereas silencing Akt signaling, through the knock-out of phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase-1, resulted in reduced phosphorylation of PLN at Thr(17). Deletion of Arg(14) disrupts the protein kinase A recognition motif, which abrogates phospholamban phosphorylation and results in constitutive SERCA inhibition.Dephosphorylated PLN tonically inhibits the SR Ca-ATPase (SERCA2a), while phosphorylation at Ser16 by PKA and Thr17 by Ca(2+) /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) relieves the inhibition, and this increases SR Ca(2+) uptake.

BTMX predicts the exposure status of known TM residues with an accuracy of 84.2% over 2,225 residues and provides a confidence score for all predictions.A method for discovering transmembrane beta-barrel proteins in Gram-negative bacterial proteomes.A web server based on the proposed method is available at http://yanbioinformatics.cs.usu.edu:8080/TMBKNNsubmit.This paper presents a k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) method for discriminating TMB and non-TMB proteins.TMBpro: secondary structure, beta-contact and tertiary structure prediction of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins.We develop a suite (TMBpro) of specialized predictors for predicting secondary structure (TMBpro-SS), beta-contacts (TMBpro-CON) and tertiary structure (TMBpro-3D) of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins.

The most common form of breast cancer begins in cells lining the ducts that carry milk to the nipple (ductal cancer). Other forms of breast cancer begin in the glands that produce milk (lobular cancer) or in other parts of the breast.\\nEarly breast cancer usually does not cause pain and may exhibit no noticeable symptoms. As the cancer progresses, signs and symptoms can include a lump or thickening in or near the breast; a change in the size or shape of the breast; nipple discharge, tenderness, or retraction (turning inward); and skin irritation, dimpling, or scaliness. These changes can occur as part of many different conditions, however. Having one or more of these symptoms does not mean that a person definitely has breast cancer.\\nIn some cases, cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body. If breast cancer spreads, cancerous cells most often appear in the bones, liver, lungs, or brain. Tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers.\\nA small percentage of all breast cancers cluster in families.

These findings demonstrate a potential link between FUS mutations and cellular pathways involved in stress responses that may be relevant to altered motor neuron homeostasis in ALS.both stress granules (TIA-1 immunoreactive) and processing bodies (P-bodies; XRN-1 immunoreactive) were more prevalent in ALS motor neurons than in controls and demonstrated strong co-localization with TDP-43.These data suggest that NFL mRNA processing is fundamentally altered in ALS spinal motor neurons to favour compartmentalization within both stress granules and P-bodies, and that TDP-43 plays a fundamental role in this process.Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) forms abnormal ubiquitinated and phosphorylated inclusions in brain tissues from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. TDP-43 is a DNA/RNA-binding protein involved in RNA processing, such as transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stabilization and transport to dendrites. We found that in response to oxidative stress and to environmental insults of different types TDP-43 is capable to assemble into stress granules (SGs), ribonucleoprotein complexes where protein synthesis is temporarily arrested. Of note, both ALS and FTD are characterized by pathological inclusions, where some well-known SG markers localize with the ALS related proteins TDP-43 and FUS.Mutations in fused in sarcoma (FUS), a DNA/RNA binding protein, have been associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS), which is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive muscular weakness and has overlapping clinical and pathologic characteristics with frontotemporal lobar degeneration.Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response.Expression of ALS-linked FUS mutations resulted in their assembly into cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs), cellular structures that package mRNA and RNA-binding proteins during cell stress.TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that is known to regulate the splicing, transport, and storage of specific mRNAs into stress granulesAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder consisting of progressive loss of motor neurons. TDP-43 has been identified as a component of ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions of motor neurons in ALS.SGs have been linked to several pathologies including inflammatory diseases, cancer, viral infection, and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)PTE significantly reduced the incorporation of R521C FUS/TLS into stress granules under stress conditions.\"}, {\"question\": \"Which could be some of the possible causes of hypersomnia?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Sleep-wake disturbances (SWD) with hypersomnia are common after traumatic brain injury (TBI), with decreased CSF levels of hypocretin-1, a wake-promoting neurotransmitter, in cases of sleep apnea, as well as in up to half the patients with dementia, particularly in vascular dementia, Korsakow syndrome, Parkinson's disease, and depression, where the alteration of sleep architecture may be pronounced, whereas in Alzheimer's disease prominent hypersomnolence or insomnia is typically only found in later stages of the diseases.\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"traumatic brain injury (TBI)\"], [\"sleep apnea\"], [\"dementia\"]], \"context\": \"Sleep-wake disturbances (SWD) are common after traumatic brain injury (TBI).

Here, we report patients treated with combination therapy after disease progression with BRAF inhibitor treatment administered before study enrollment (part B; n = 26) or after cross-over at progression with dabrafenib monotherapy (part C; n = 45). This randomized phase 3 study evaluated the combination of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib. METHODS: All patients treated with the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib or dabrafenib or combination BRAF inhibitor and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor therapy at Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia underwent regular dermatological assessments for the duration of therapy.We assessed the safety and efficacy of combined BRAF inhibition with vemurafenib and MEK inhibition with cobimetinib in patients with advanced BRAF-mutated melanoma. We included individuals who had either recently progressed on vemurafenib or never received a BRAF inhibitor. However, it is becoming evident that the effects of paradoxical mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation by BRAF inhibitors in non-BRAF-mutant cells needs to be taken into account, which may be implicated in the problems encountered in the first clinical trial testing a combination of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4), with significant liver toxicities.The BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib recently was approved for use in patients with BRAF V600-mutated metastatic melanoma.His treatment course to date has included surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy, and interferon, metastasectomies, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors, a clinical trial with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX-4032), clinical trial with combination BRAF plus MEK inhibition with vemurafenib plus GDC-0973, and combination targeted and immune therapy with vemurafenib plus the anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab.Thirty-one patients commenced dabrafenib therapy including six individuals who had progressed on a prior BRAF-inhibitor treatment.Population pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib, a BRAF inhibitor: effect of dose, time, covariates, and relationship with its metabolites.Dabrafenib is a BRAF kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of BRAF V600E mutation-positive melanoma. This was a prospective study of melanoma patients harboring the BRAF V600 mutation and treated with iBRAF within a clinical trial (dabrafenib) or as part of an expanded access program (vemurafenib).We investigated the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib in patients with advanced melanoma with symptomatic brain metastases.This discovery led to the development of BRAF kinase inhibitors like vemurafenib and dabrafenib. CONCLUSIONS: Dabrafenib joins vemurafenib to confirm the superior clinical outcome of the BRAF inhibitors when compared with dacarbazine in patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive advanced melanoma. Tumor genetic analyses of patients with metastatic melanoma treated with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (GSK2118436).PURPOSE: Dabrafenib is a selective inhibitor of V600-mutant BRAF kinase, which recently showed improved progression-free survival (PFS) as compared with dacarbazine, in metastatic melanoma patients. Phase II trial (BREAK-2) of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (GSK2118436) in patients with metastatic melanoma.PURPOSE: Dabrafenib (GSK2118436) is a potent inhibitor of mutated BRAF kinase.Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is a concerning toxicity with BRAF inhibitors in the treatment for melanoma. While the two drugs shown to improve survival, vemurafenib, and dabrafenib, have similar efficacy, the reported rates of cSCC are quite different.PURPOSE To assess pharmacodynamic effects and intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, leading to an understanding of the mechanism of action of vemurafenib and ultimately to optimization of metastatic melanoma therapy. BACKGROUND: The cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test is a CE-marked and FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic assay used to select patients with metastatic melanoma for treatment with the selective BRAF inhibitor vemurafenibThe purpose of this study is to review the development of BRAF inhibitors, with emphasis on the trials conducted with dabrafenib (GSK2118436) and the evolving role of dabrafenib in treatment for melanoma patients.Dabrafenib inhibits the mutant BRAF (BRAF(mut)) protein in melanomas with BRAF(V600E) and BRAF(V600K) genotypes.To address this problem, we conducted a phase 1 and 2 trial of combined treatment with dabrafenib, a selective BRAF inhibitor, and trametinib, a selective MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor.Cutaneous manifestations of dabrafenib (GSK2118436): a selective inhibitor of mutant BRAF in patients with metastatic melanoma.We conducted a systematic prospective dermatological review of all patients enrolled at a single institution in the phase I/II clinical trial of the mutant BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (GSK2118436).CONCLUSIONS: Administration of the mutant BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib is associated with induction of keratinocytic proliferation, which in some cases develops features of low-grade malignancy.Neoplastic leptomeningitis presenting in a melanoma patient treated with dabrafenib (a V600EBRAF inhibitor): a case report.For this reason, she was enrolled into another clinical trial with the GSK2118436 BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib, as a second line of therapy.BACKGROUND: The development of keratoacanthomas (KAs) and well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) is a known adverse effect of novel BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib.OBSERVATIONS: We describe a patient with stage IV melanoma who received the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration) as part of a clinical trial and developed numerous diffuse, pathology-proven KAs and SCCs. CONCLUSIONS: Given vemurafenib's recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration, we provide a timely case report on the effective use of PDT in the treatment of BRAF inhibitor-associated KAs and SCCs. The BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, has shown up to 78% objective response rates in melanoma patients harboring the BRAF-V600E mutation but not in patients lacking the mutation. The oral BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) frequently produced tumor regressions in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma in a phase 1 trial and improved overall survival in a phase 3 trial. CONTEXT: A polymerase chain reaction-based companion diagnostic (cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test) was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to select patients with BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma for treatment with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. However, in the recent clinical trial of the BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib (PLX4032), a significant percentage of BRAF V600E mutant melanoma patients did not meet the RECIST criteria for a response. Vemurafenib (RG7204/PLX4032), a small-molecule inhibitor of mutant BRAF, has shown striking clinical efficacy in BRAFV600 mutant melanoma, creating the need for a well-validated companion diagnostic to select patients for treatment.BACKGROUND: Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) have shown response rates of more than 50% in patients with metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation.Vemurafenib is the first molecularly targeted therapy to be licensed in the US and Europe for treatment of advanced melanomaClinical trials to test the efficacy of vemurafenib in combination with immunomodulatory agents, such as ipilimumab, and MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors, such as GDC-0973, in the treatment of advanced melanoma are currently underway\"}, {\"question\": \"which are the risk factors for sudden cardiac death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"The following risk factors for sudden cardiac death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have been identified: 1) previous cardiac arrest; 2) sustained ventricular tachycardia; 3) family history of sudden cardiac death; 4) high-risk genetic mutations; 5) unexplained syncope; 6) non-sustained ventricular tachycardia; 7) hypotensive response to exercise; 8) marked left ventricular hypertrophy; 9) J-wave on ECG and 10) myocardial fibrosis using late gadolinium enhancement\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"myocardial fibrosis using late gadolinium enhancement\"], [\"J-wave on ECG\"], [\"Extreme left ventricular hypertrophy (>30mm)\"], [\"Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia\"], [\"Sustained ventricular tachycardia\"], [\"previous cardiac arrest\"], [\"family history of sudden cardiac death\"], [\"unexplained syncope\"], [\"hypotensive response to exercise\"], [\"high-risk genetic mutations\"]], \"context\": \"Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is used in the diagnosis and risk stratification of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and can detect myocardial replacement fibrosis (anindependent predictor of adverse cardiac outcomes) using late gadolinium enhancement (LGE).

However, LGE was strongly associated with surrogates of arrhythmia and remained a significant associate of subsequent SCD and/or ICD discharge after controlling for other variables. If replicated, LGE may be considered an important risk factor for sudden death in patients with HCM.In conclusion, our cohort study results do not support LVOTO as an independent risk factor for SD in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.The appearance of a \\\"hump\\\" at the ST segment during exercise testing appears to be a risk factor for SCD in patients with HCM.

In patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for primary prevention, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was the risk factor with the highest predictive value.

Inhibition of HDAC6 results in higher levels of acetylated tubulin and enhanced binding of the motor protein kinesin-1 to tubulin, which promotes transport of cargoes along microtubules.Alcohol-induced alterations in hepatic microtubule dynamics can be explained by impaired histone deacetylase 6 functionAddition of trichostatin A (TSA), an HDAC6 inhibitor, induced microtubule acetylation to the same extent as in ethanol-treated cells (approximately threefold).Interestingly, HDAC6 from ethanol-treated cells was able to bind and deacetylate exogenous tubulin to the same extent as control, suggesting that ethanol-induced tubulin modifications prevented HDAC6 binding to endogenous microtubules.We propose that lower HDAC6 levels combined with decreased microtubule binding lead to increased tubulin acetylation in ethanol-treated cells.The results also showed that both pan-HDAC and class-I-specific inhibitor treatment resulted in increased acetylation of histones, but only pan-HDAC inhibitor treatment resulted in increased tubulin acetylation, which is in agreement with their activity towards the HDAC6 isoform.Nicotinamide but not 3-aminobenzamide, an inhibitor for poly(ADP)ribose polymerase, enhanced tubulin acetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in cultured cerebellar granule cells from wild-type (WT) mice, suggesting that mammalian Sir2-related protein (SIRT) 2, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)--dependent tubulin deacetylase, could modulate resistance to axonal degeneration.Moreover, SIRT2 overexpression abrogated microtubule hyperacetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in these cells.Conversely, SIRT2 knockdown by using a lentiviral vector expressing small interfering RNA, enhanced microtubule acetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in WT granule cells.Taken together, these results suggest that SIRT2-mediated tubulin deacetylation is involved in both microtubule hyperacetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in Wld(S) granule cells.Compared to control cultures, higher levels of acetylated tubulin were found in neurons treated with tubacin\"}, {\"question\": \"List all approved indications for Glivec\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"CML - blast crisis, in accelerated phase, and in chronic phase after interferon failure or intolerance.

However, it is a challenge to obtain high enough numbers of primary DCs for immunotherapy, since their frequency in blood is very low. We therefore explored the possibility to generate them from hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs).

Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the degradation of amines, has been reported to be associated with aggression, impulsivity, depression, and mood changes.Monoamine Oxidase A (MAOA) is a critical enzyme in the catabolism of monoaminergic neurotransmitters. Monoamine oxidases (MAO-A and MAO-B) have a key role in the degradation of amine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin. Inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a mitochondrial enzyme that degrades neurotransmitters including serotonin and norepinephrine, are commonly used to treat neurological conditions including depression. Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is one of the major enzymes responsible for the degradation of neurotransmitters.Monoamine oxidase membrane enzymes are responsible for the catalytic breakdown of extra- and intracellular neurotransmitters Monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) is a key mitochondrial enzyme that metabolizes biogenic amine neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotoninThe monoamine oxidase-A (MAOA) gene plays a vital role in the metabolism of neurotransmitters, e.g, serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. \"}, {\"question\": \"Which are the subtypes of Pfeiffer syndrome?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Pfeiffer syndrome is divided into three clinical subtypes.\", \"Pfeiffer syndrome is divided into three clinical subtypes.

Type 2 consists of cloverleaf skull, extreme proptosis, finger and toe abnormalities, elbow ankylosis or synostosis, developmental delay and neurological complications. Type 3 is similar to type 2 but without a cloverleaf skull. Recently, based on clinical findings, the disorder has been divided into three subtypes: type 1, characterized by mild expression; type 2, in which clover leaf skull deformity and multiple congenital anomalies are present at birth; and type 3, which is similar to type 2, but lacks the presence of the clover leaf skull at birth. It is a clinically variable disorder and has been divided into three subtypes [Cohen, 1993: Am J Med Genet 45:300-307]. Type 1 represents the less severe cases, while types 2 and 3 are the more severe cases. These latter types tend to have a higher risk for neurodevelopmental problems and a reduced life expectancy.Classic Pfeiffer syndrome is designated type I. Type 2 consists of cloverleaf skull with Pfeiffer hands and feet together with ankylosis of the elbows. Such patients do poorly with an early death. All reported instances to date have been sporadic. Type 3 is similar to type 2 but without cloverleaf skull. Ocular proptosis is severe in degree and the anterior cranial base is markedly short. These patients also do poorly and tend to have an early death. To date all cases have occurred sporadically. Although these 3 clinical subtypes do not have status as separate entities, their diagnostic and prognostic implications are important. Type 1 is commonly associated with normal intelligence, generally good outcome, and can be found dominantly inherited in some families. Types 2 and 3 generally have severe neurological compromise, poor prognosis, early death, and sporadic occurrence. \"}, {\"question\": \"Which genes does thyroid hormone receptor beta1 regulate in the heart?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"\\u03b2-MHC, HCN4, KCND2/3, SERCA, TRbeta1, alpha-MHC\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"\\u03b2-MHC\"], [\"HCN4\"], [\"KCND2/3\"], [\"SERCA\"], [\"TRbeta1\"], [\"alpha-MHC\"]], \"context\": \"we identified thyroid hormone receptor \\u03b21 (TR\\u03b21), which negatively regulates \\u03b2-MHC transcription, as a target of miR-27aHCN2 gene expression was not significantly affected by TR beta 1.

The biological activity of circulating TSH was slightly below the normal range [TSH bioactivity (B) to immunoreactivity (I) ratio (TSH B/I) = 0.4, normal: 0.6-2.2].We report a boy with confirmed Williams-Beuren syndrome, who was found to have classical growth hormone deficiency and responded well to growth hormone therapy.A 31-year-old man who had been under regular hemodialysis for 6 months was diagnosed as Williams syndrome (WS) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) chromosomal analysis. The association of WS and chronic renal failure (CRF) is only rarely encountered. Endocrinological examinations revealed hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Prolonged and exaggerated responses of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) were also noted.Involvement of the calcitonin/CGRP gene in Williams syndrome is postulated on the basis that Williams syndrome children often have infantile hypercalcemia and deficient expression of calcitonin, a hormone that lowers serum calcium levels. To test the hypothesis that mutations in the calcitonin/CGRP gene might be responsible for the reduced calcitonin levelsIt has been suggested that a defect in calcitonin function may play a role in Williams syndromeImparied calcitonin secretion in patients with Williams syndrome.in patients with Williams syndrome, we studied five such children, with intravenous calcium and parathyroid hormone infusions as provocative stimuli. These patients were found to have significantly higher mean baseline calcium concentrations, delayed clearance of calcium after intravenous calcium loading, and blunted calcitonin responses after calcium infusionOur studies demonstrate that patients with Williams syndrome have a defect in the synthesis or release of immunoreactive calcitonin. A deficiency of calcitonin may explain the abnormalities of calcium metabolism seen in these patients and can serve as an important endocrine marker for Williams syndrome.A 16-year-old male adolescent diagnosed to have the Williams-Beuren syndrome was referred to our obesity outpatient clinic, due to his morbid obesity (body mass index 39.2 kilograms per square metre) and gluttony.

The basic steps followed in these approaches consist of (i) all-against-all sequence comparison, (ii) detection of non-overlapping similarities of two genes/proteins (components) to a single gene/protein (composite), and optionally (iii) elimination of putative spurious hits (e.g. due to promiscuous domains) achieves via clustering based on sequence similarity and examining dense regions of the resulting graph or by querying the PFAM database.

This method is of particular interest for studying genes that exhibit no, or only remote, homologies with already well-characterized proteinsThis chapter uses the FusionDB database (http://www.igs.cnrs-mrs.fr/FusionDB/) as source of information. FusionDB provides a characterization of a large number of gene fusion events at hand of multiple sequence alignments.PLEX can be searched iteratively and also enables searches for chromosomal gene neighbors and Rosetta Stone linkages.While phylogenomic profiles remain the central focus of Phydbac2, it now integrates chromosomal proximity and gene fusion analyses as two additional non-similarity-based indicators for inferring pairwise gene functional relationships.Functional links between proteins can often be inferred from genomic associations between the genes that encode them: groups of genes that are required for the same function tend to show similar species coverage, are often located in close proximity on the genome (in prokaryotes), and tend to be involved in gene-fusion events. The database STRING is a precomputed global resource for the exploration and analysis of these associations.Protein interaction maps for complete genomes based on gene fusion eventsHere we present a method that identifies gene-fusion events in complete genomes, solely based on sequence comparison.Gene fusions have been suggested to be useful characters for identifying evolutionary relationships because they constitute synapomorphies or cladistic characters.

A 21-gene (Oncotype DX\\u00ae; Genomic Health, Inc., Redwood City, CA) recurrence score (RS) is prognostic for recurrence and predictive of chemotherapy benefit.We hypothesized that a distinct network of immune function genes at the tumor site can predict a low risk versus high risk of distant relapse in breast cancer patients regardless of the status of ER, PR, or HER-2/neu in their tumors.Real-time RT-PCR confirmed the 5-gene prognostic signature that was distinct from an FDA-cleared 70-gene signature of MammaPrint panel and from the Oncotype DX recurrence score assay panel.

This study evaluates the association of Forkhead-box protein A1 (FOXA1) and GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3) expressions with Oncotype DX recurrences scores in 77 cases of patients with ER-positive node-negative breast carcinomas diagnosed at Indiana University.the use of the Oncotype DX assay in estrogen receptor-positive node-negative breast cancer patients were incorporated into guidelines from both the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. The Oncotype DX assay is a diagnostic test which measures changes in a set of 21 genes in order to predict the likelihood of disease recurrence and also to predict which patients are most likely to respond to chemotherapy.The EWG found adequate evidence regarding the association of the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score with disease recurrence and adequate evidence for response to chemotherapy.EWG) found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of tumor gene expression profiles to improve outcomes in defined populations of women with breast cancer.confirmed the clinical validity of the Oncotype DX breast cancer assay, not only as a way to predict recurrence but also as a tool for determining therapeutic benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.Over several decades, investigators working through National Cancer Institute-sponsored Cooperative Groups have contributed to major advances in the endocrine treatment of breast cancer.Cooperative Group studies have contributed to the development of a molecular profiling test, Oncotype Dx, which identifies women who have an excellent prognosis with hormonal therapy alone.In this report we compare the prognostic and predictive utility of these two tools in node-negative, ER-positive breast cancerThe Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early breast cancer that is newly diagnosed.78 women, treated for early-stage, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer with 0-3 positive lymph nodes, whose medical records indicated they received Oncotype DX testing earlier.A retrospective chart review of 58 T1/T2, node-negative, estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer patients that underwent Oncotype DX gene assay testing between January and December 2006 was performed.\"}, {\"question\": \"Which are the DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases inhibitors?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"DNA (Cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases are a family of enzymes that methylate DNA at the C5 position of cytosine residues.

Although 5-Aza-CdR is known to be incorporated into DNA and inhibit DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases, the precise mechanisms underlying the drug's antineoplastic activity remain unclear.The mechanism of inhibition of DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases by 5-azacytosine is likely to involve methyl transfer to the inhibitor.The mechanism of inhibition of DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases by the mechanism-based inhibitor 5-azacytosine has remained unclear, mainly because of the unavailability of a substrate in which the inhibitor, but not normal cytosine, is present at the target site.These results suggest that, when the enzyme binds to 5-azacytosine in the presence of the cofactor, a methyl group is transferred to the N-5 position of the base, resulting in the inactivation of the enzyme.Rapid synthesis of new DNMT inhibitors derivatives of procainamide.Six compounds resulted in potent inhibitors of the murine catalytic Dnmt3A/3L complex and of human DNMT1, at least 50 times greater than that of the parent compounds. The inhibitors showed selectivity for C5 DNA methyltransferases.DNA (Cytosine-C5) methyltransferase inhibition by oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone (zebularine aglycon) at the enzymatic target site.A number of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are known to reactivate silenced genes; including 5-azacytidine and 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone riboside (zebularine). Zebularine is a more stable, less cytotoxic inhibitor compared to 5-azacytidine.ODNs containing 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone at the enzymatic target site are competitive inhibitors of both prokaryotic and mammalian DNA C5 methyltransferases. We determined that the ternary complexes between the enzymes, 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone inhibitor, and the cofactor S-adenosyl methionine are maintained through the formation of a reversible covalent interaction. The differing stability and reversibility of the covalent bonds may partially account for the observed differences in cytotoxicity between zebularine and 5-azacytidine inhibitors.DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are a family of enzymes that methylate DNA at the C5 position of cytosine residues, and their inhibition is a promising strategy for the treatment of various developmental and proliferative diseases, particularly cancers.The inhibitory activity of hydralazine toward DNMT may be rationalized at the molecular level by similar interactions within the binding pocket (e.g., by a similar pharmacophore) as established by substrate-like deoxycytidine analogues.Despite the different scaffolds of other non-nucleoside DNMT inhibitors such as procaine and procainamide, the current modeling work reveals that these drugs exhibit similar interactions within the DNMT1 binding site. These findings are valuable in guiding the rational design and virtual screening of novel DNMT inhibitors.Inhibition of HhaI DNA (Cytosine-C5) methyltransferase by oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine: examination of the intertwined roles of co-factor, target, transition state structure and enzyme conformation.The presence of 5-azacytosine (ZCyt) residues in DNA leads to potent inhibition of DNA (cytosine-C5) methyltranferases (C5-MTases) in vivo and in vitro.Thus, it is important to understand the critical mechanistic determinants of ZCyt's inhibitory action.Since methyl transfer can occur only in the presence of AdoMet, these results suggest (1) that the inhibitory capacity of ZCyt in DNA is based on its ability to induce a stable, tightly closed conformation of M.HhaI that prevents DNA and co-factor release and (2) that methylation of ZCyt in DNA is not required for inhibition of M.HhaI.Zebularine: a novel DNA methylation inhibitor that forms a covalent complex with DNA methyltransferases.The inhibition of cytosine-[C5]-specific DNA methyltransferases (C5 MTases) by oligodeoxynucleotides containing 5-azadeoxycytidine (AzadC) and 5-fluorodeoxycytidine (FdC) provides a well-documented example of mechanism-based inhibition of enzymes central to nucleic acid metabolism.Synthesis of oligonucleotide inhibitors of DNA (Cytosine-C5) methyltransferase containing 5-azacytosine residues at specific sites.The incorporation of 5-azacytosine residues into DNA causes potent inhibition of DNA (Cytosine-C5) methyltransferases.

Current treatment strategies in patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma include surgical resection with post-operative radiotherapy and concomitant/adjuvant temozolomide (the \\\"Stupp protocol\\\") or resection with implantation of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers in the surgical cavity followed by radiotherapy. The standard treatment today is maximal surgical resection followed by concomitant chemo-radiation therapy followed by adjuvant TMZ according to Stupp protocol. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 191 patients with primary GBM were postoperatively treated with either radiation and concomitant TMZ, followed by adjuvant TMZ (Stupp protocol) (n = 154), or radiation followed by adjuvant TMZ (n = 37).Afterward, patients received concomitant radiochemotherapy according to the Stupp protocol. The treatment of glioblastoma includes surgery followed by chemoradiation with the protocol of Stupp et al. Since the publication of a study by Stupp et al in 2005, which used a protocol of conventional fractionated irradiation with concomitant TMZ followed by standard TMZ for six cycles, many clinical studies in the People's Republic of China have demonstrated that such a treatment strategy has significantly improved efficacy with limited side effects for newly diagnosed glioblastoma after surgery as compared with strategies that do not contain TMZ.Standard chemoradiotherapy as per the Stupp protocol, together with multimodal rehabilitation, resulted in substantial functional improvement within 6 weeks of initiation.BACKGROUND: Patients with glioblastoma treated with BCNU wafer implantation for recurrence frequently receive frontline chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide as part of the Stupp protocol.This is followed by concurrent radio-chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) according to the Stupp protocol. CONCLUSIONS: MGMT promoter methylation status and low MGMT expression both were identified as positive prognosticators in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma who underwent surgical resection and received Gliadel wafer implants followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and concomitant oral TMZ chemotherapy (the Stupp protocol).INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the incidence and impact of early post-chemoradiation (cRT) 'pseudoprogression' (PsPD) amongst glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients treated with the current standard of care - 60 Gy conformal radiotherapy with concurrent low-dose temozolomide, followed by six cycles of high-dose temozolomide (the 'Stupp protocol'). In patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), there is no consensus on the sequential use of two existing regimens: post-operative Gliadel implantation into the surgical cavity and concomitant temozolomide with radiotherapy followed by adjuvant temozolomide ('Stupp protocol'). We also screened for associations between the level of methylation of CpG sites and overall survival in a cohort of 50 patients uniformly treated by surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (STUPP protocol). Surprisingly, less than half the patients having surgery received concomitant radiochemotherapy according to the Stupp protocol. We analyzed MGMT methylation by methylation-specific PCR in 90 GBM patients from four Portuguese hospitals, uniformly treated with radiotherapy combined with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (Stupp protocol).The current care standards for newly diagnosed glioblastoma consist, when feasible, in surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, as described in the Stupp protocol. Moreover, there are no data concerning the effect of concomitant radiochemotherapy according to the STUPP protocol on the course ofMS in patients with coexisting glioblastoma.

Early stroke risk is especially high in TIA patients with a high ABCD2 score of 4 or more (A age over 60 years [1 point]: B blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg [1 point]: C Clinical features, including unilateral weakness [2 points] and speech disturbance without weakness [1 point] D2: Diabetes [1 point] and Duration of symptoms [1 point for < 60 min and 2 points for > 60 min]), acute ischemic lesions on diffusion weighted image, > 50% carotid stenosis, severe intracranial artery stenosis, microembolic signals on transcranial Doppler, atrial fibrillation, or hypercoagulable states.STUDY OBJECTIVE: We evaluate, in admitted patients with transient ischemic attack, the accuracy of the ABCD(2) (age [A], blood pressure [B], clinical features [weakness/speech disturbance] [C], transient ischemic attack duration [D], and diabetes history [D]) score in predicting ischemic stroke within 7 days. Our goal was to compare the very early predictive accuracy of the most relevant clinical scores [age, blood pressure, clinical features and duration of symptoms (ABCD) score, ABCD and diabetes (ABCD2) score, ABCD and brain infarction on imaging score, ABCD2 and brain infarction on imaging score, ABCD and prior TIA within 1 week of the index event (ABCD3) score, California Risk Score, Essen Stroke Risk Score and Stroke Prognosis Instrument II] in consecutive transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients.The risk of stroke after a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) can be predicted by scores incorporating age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration (ABCD-score), and diabetes (ABCD2-score).BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The risk of stroke after a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) can be predicted by scores incorporating age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration (ABCD-score), and diabetes (ABCD2-score).\"}, {\"question\": \"Which are the musculoskeletal manifestations of Marfan syndrome?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Musculoskeletal manifestations of Marfan syndrome include scoliosis, dural ectasia, pectus excavatum and carinatum, arachnodactyly, otto pelvis (protrusio acetabuli), dolichostenomelia and ligamentous laxity.\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"scoliosis\"], [\"dural ectasia\"], [\"pectus excavatum and carinatum\"], [\"arachnodactyly\"], [\"otto pelvis\", \"protrusio acetabuli\"], [\"dolichostenomelia\"], [\"ligamentous laxity\"]], \"context\": \"Musculoskeletal manifestations include scoliosis, dural ectasia, protrusio acetabuli, and ligamentous laxity.Scoliosis, pectus excavatum and carinatum, arachnodactyly, and acetabular protrusion are common musculoskeletal manifestations.Two cases are described in which protrusio acetabuli was a major problem.

We identified 23 children,Adverse effects were noted in 6 children.To determine the effectiveness of gabapentin as an add-on therapy in children presenting with overactive bladder (OAB)Data were analyzed in 30 patients as treatment was terminated in 1 due to adverse effects.Gabapentin gives moderate results in children with OAB refractory to conventional anticholinergics. In general, the drug is well tolerated with fewer adverse effects.To describe a child who developed a skin reaction during gabapentin therapy and discuss how we evaluated the probability of an adverse drug reactionIn contrast to other antiepileptic drugs, skin reactions to gabapentin are considered uncommon. In adults, reported prevalence of rash possibly related to gabapentin range from 1% to 10%. A postmarketing surveillance study reported gabapentin treatment failure as a consequence of rash in 0.4% of 3000 patients. The product monograph does not mention rash in children.This case, and limited literature data, suggest that gabapentin may cause rash that is severe enough to necessitate discontinuation in a small percentage of children. Further research is needed to determine the actual incidence and severity of gabapentin-related rash in this population.Five patients treated in the Children's Hospital Pain Control Service for intractable neuropathic pain were included in gabapentin treatmentWe noticed a rapid improvement, in 1 week, of our patients' VAS scores (from 9 or 10 to 4 or 3) with minimal adverse effectsThe charts of all children given gabapentin for seizures were reviewed.Only 8 children (7%) reported adverse effects, and the drug was discontinued in two.A postmarketing surveillance study of gabapentin as add-on therapy for 3,100 patients in England.The cohort comprised 3,100 patients, of whom 136 (4%) were children.The most frequently reported adverse events reported during the first month of treatment, drowsiness/sedation, dizziness, and malaise/lassitude, also were the commonest reasons for discontinuing GBP and reported as suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs)Neurologic-related events were the most frequently reported adverse events. They also were the commonest reasons for discontinuing treatment and reported as suspected ADRs.We reviewed the reports in the literature on the safety, adverse effects and tolerance of GBP as treatment, used as monotherapy or associated with other drugs, in epilepsies in patients of all age groups, including children, adults and the elderlyGBP is a well tolerated drug when used for monotherapy or associated with other antiepileptic drugs. The commonest adverse effects seen were somnolence, fainting, ataxia, nystagmus, tremor and headache. However, their incidence was low and intensity mild. There was no clear relationship between the dose given and appearance of side effects, except for fainting and somnolence.GBP is a drug which is free of unwanted side effects. Its safety and tolerability profile is excellent for treatment of simple and complex partial crises, with or without generalization in epileptic patients of all ages.Two studies were conducted to determine the single-dose pharmacokinetics of gabapentin in healthy subjects age 1 month to 12 years and to guide dose selection in safety and efficacy trials in pediatric patientsSingle doses of gabapentin were well tolerated by healthy pediatric subjects.The efficacy and safety of gabapentin as add-on therapy for refractory partial seizures in 237 children, aged 3 to 12 years were evaluated over a 6-month period.Thirteen patients (5%) withdrew during the 6-month period because of adverse events.Male or female patients, at least 12 years old, with a recent history of partial seizures with or without secondary generalization, were randomized to receive gabapentinOf the four most common adverse events (somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue), only one, dizziness, occurred more often in the nontitrated (Rapid initiation) group than in the titrated (Slow initiation) group.Twenty-six children with intellectual disability and six normal children, all suffering from refractory partial seizures, received open-label gabapentin (range = 10-50 mg kg(-1) day(-1); mean = 26.7 mg kg(-1) day(-1) as an add-on medication to their antiepileptic drug regimenIn the present patient population, patients younger than 10 years of age, all of whom had intellectual disability, were more likely to have side-effects than those older than 10 years of age. Observed adverse effects, which were generally mild, occurred in patients with baseline intellectual disability, attention deficit disorder and behavioural problems. Behavioural adverse effects warranted discontinuation of the medication in only three patients. The severity of intellectual disability (mild versus moderate or severe) did not affect the extent of the response or the occurrence of side-effects.However, children with intellectual disability who also are less than 10 years of age with baseline attention deficit appear to be at a higher risk of behavioural side-effects.Efficacy and safety of gabapentin monotherapy were evaluated in 33 children with newly diagnosed absence epilepsySomnolence and dizziness were the only adverse events reported by at least two patients during gabapentin treatment. No clinically important changes in laboratory assessments or other safety parameters were observed.Thirty-two children with refractory partial epilepsy received open-label gabapentin as an additional medication to their antiepileptic drug regimenThe major reported side effects were behavioral. These consisted of hyperactivity, irritability, and agitation that occurred in patients with baseline mental retardation with attention deficit.We report 2 children who received GBP for intractable seizures and who developed intolerable aggressive behavior requiring dose reduction or drug discontinuation. Behavioral changes should be recognized as a possible side effect of GBP, especially in mentally retarded children.We report 7 children who received gabapentin (GBP) as adjunctive medic ation and subsequently developed behavioral side effects. These behavioral changes consisted of intensification of baseline behaviors as well as new behavioral problems. Behaviors that parents considered most troublesome were tantrums, aggression directed toward others, hyperactivity, and defiance. All behavioral changes were reversible and were managed by dose reduction or discontinuation of GBP. All children had baseline attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and developmental delays.We described 3 learning disabled children, 1 aged 7 and 2 aged 10 years, with intractable partial seizures who developed severe behavioral problems while receiving modest doses of GBP. The children became hyperactive and had explosive outburst consisting of aggressive and oppositional behavior. The behavioral problems were sufficiently severe to require discontinuation of GBP despite moderately improved seizure control.\"}, {\"question\": \"Which are the 3 basic transcription factors that have been used for the direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes or cardiomyocyte like-cells?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Direct reprogramming of human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) into cardiomyocytes may hold great potential for this purpose.

Using calcium activity as our primary outcome measure, we compared several published combinations of transcription factors along with novel combinations in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The most effective combination consisted of Hand2, Nkx2.5, Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (HNGMT). This combination is >50-fold more efficient than GMT alone and produces iCMs with cardiomyocyte marker expression, robust calcium oscillation, and spontaneous beating that persist for weeks following inactivation of reprogramming factors.Here we show that four human cardiac transcription factors, including GATA binding protein 4, Hand2, T-box5, and myocardin, and two microRNAs, miR-1 and miR-133, activated cardiac marker expression in neonatal and adult human fibroblasts.

AF was stimulated with an intra-esophageal burst pacing protocol in the 3 CPVT mouse models (RyR2-R2474S+/-, 70%; RyR2-N2386I+/-, 60%; RyR2-L433P+/-, 35.71%) but not in wild-type (WT) mice (P<0.05).The RyR2-G230C mutant exhibits similar biophysical defects compared with previously characterized CPVT mutations: decreased binding of the stabilizing subunit calstabin2 and a leftward shift in the Ca(2+) dependence for activation under conditions that simulate exercise, consistent with a \\\"leaky\\\" channel. Both RyR2-G230C and RyR2-P2328S channels exhibit normal luminal Ca(2+) activation. Thus, diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) leak caused by reduced calstabin2 binding and a leftward shift in the Ca(2+) dependence for activation by diastolic levels of cytosolic Ca(2+) is a common mechanism underlying CPVT.A novel CPVT mutation, E189D, was identified. The E189D mutation does not alter the affinity of the channel for FKBP12.6, but it increases the propensity for store-overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR). Furthermore, the E189D mutation enhances the basal channel activity of RyR2 and its sensitivity to activation by caffeine. The E189D RyR2 mutation is causative for CPVT and functionally increases the propensity for SOICR without altering the affinity for FKBP12.6.We found that mice heterozygous for the R2474S mutation in Ryr2 (Ryr2-R2474S mice) exhibited spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures (which occurred in the absence of cardiac arrhythmias), exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death.  Thus, CPVT-associated mutant leaky Ryr2-R2474S channels in the brain can cause seizures in mice, independent of cardiac arrhythmias.We screened 12 Finnish CPVT probands for mutations in these genes and identified three novel RYR2 mutations (V2306I, P4902L, R4959Q), which were absent in unaffected and control individuals.RyR2 mutations suggested to cause defective Ca2+ channel function have recently been identified in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) affected individuals. We report expression of three CPVT-linked human RyR2 (hRyR2) mutations (S2246L, N4104K, and R4497C) in HL-1 cardiomyocytes displaying correct targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum. We developed a conditional knock-in mouse model carrier of the R4496C mutation, the mouse equivalent to the R4497C mutations identified in CPVT families, to evaluate if the animals would develop a CPVT phenotype and if beta blockers would prevent arrhythmias.These data provide the first experimental demonstration that the R4496C RyR2 mutation predisposes the murine heart to VT and VF in response caffeine and/or adrenergic stimulation.We developed a conditional knock-in mouse model carrier of the R4496C mutation, the mouse equivalent to the R4497C mutations identified in CPVT families, to evaluate if the animals would develop a CPVT phenotype and if beta blockers would prevent arrhythmias\"}, {\"question\": \"Which are the most widely reported side-effects in the treatment of Crohn's disease?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Leukopenia, paresthesia, psoriasis, alopecia and hemolysis are the most commonly reported side effects depending on the treatment.

Glutamate metabolism is impaired in transgenic mice with tau hyperphosphorylation.In neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia, the protein tau is hyperphosphorylated and eventually aggregates to develop neurofibrillary tangles. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a marker of neuronal alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies, are comprised of aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein.At 24 months, NFTs progress, tau inclusions propagate to the dentate gyrus, and neuronal loss is evident. At autopsy, brains of AD and a subset of TBI victims display some similarities including accumulation of A\\u03b2 peptides and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. The pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD)--widespread synaptic and neuronal loss and the pathological accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (A\\u03b2) in senile plaques, as well as hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles--have been known for many decades, but the links between AD pathology and dementia and effective therapeutic strategies remain elusive. The microtubule-associated protein tau, in a hyperphosphorylated form, aggregates into insoluble paired-helical filaments (PHFs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies.Pseudohyperphosphorylation causing AD-like changes in tau has significant effects on its polymerization.In AD, kinases such as glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) are believed to be involved in the generation of hyperphosphorylated tau. However, the functional consequences of hyperphosphorylation on the microtubule binding and polymerization of tau are not well understood. Pseudophosphorylation of tau decreases its affinity for microtubules, and pseudohyperphosphorylated forms of tau do not have significantly decreased levels of microtubule binding as compared to single and double sites. On the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation.Microtubule-associated protein tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated and aggregated in affected neurons of Alzheimer disease brain.In several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, the neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment, and aggregates into insoluble filaments.Tau is the major component of the neurofibrillar tangles that are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimers' disease.Aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are found in a group of diseases called tauopathies, which includes Alzheimers diseaseIn several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, the neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment, and aggregates into insoluble filamentsOn the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimers disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formationIn the brains of individuals with Alzheimers disease, tau is hyperphosphorylated and aggregated into intraneuronal deposits called neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)Neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads, both made of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, point to an alteration of microtubules in Alzheimers diseaseHyperphosphorylation, which diminishes the microtubule-binding capacity of tau, destabilizes microtubules and may enhance the formation of paired helical filaments that constitute neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease. In several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, the neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment, and aggregates into insoluble filaments. The consequences of the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the somatodendritic compartment remain poorly characterized at the early stage of disease before the formation of tau insoluble filaments.Microtubule-associated protein tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated and aggregated in affected neurons of Alzheimer disease brain. This hyperphosphorylated tau can be dephosphorylated at some of the abnormal phosphorylated sites by purified protein phosphatase-1, 2A, and 2B in vitro.Adult human nerve cells contain tau protein, a phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein, that is hyperphosphorylated in the fetus and in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Hyperphosphorylation, which diminishes the microtubule-binding capacity of tau, destabilizes microtubules and may enhance the formation of paired helical filaments that constitute neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease.Importantly, hyperphosphorylated tau comprises the paired helical filament, whose pathological deposition as neurofibrillary tangles is implicated in Alzheimer's disease; hyperphosphorylated tau is also implicated in the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative disorders.In Alzheimer disease (AD) brain tau is ~three to four-fold more hyperphosphorylated than the normal adult brain tau and in this hyperphosphorylated state it is polymerized into paired helical filaments ([PHF) admixed with straight filaments (SF) forming neurofibrillary tangles.\"}, {\"question\": \"Which diseases are involved in the severe cutaneous reactions (SCAR) spectrum?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"The diseases that are involved in the severe cutaneous reactions (SCAR) spectrum are:\\n1) Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)\\n2) Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)\\n3) Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP).\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"Stevens-Johnson syndrome\", \"SJS\"], [\"Toxic epidermal necrolysis\", \"TEN\"], [\"Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis\", \"AGEP\"]], \"context\": \"Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are diseases within the spectrum of severe cutaneous adverse reactions affecting skin and mucous membranes.

A variant allele of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B, HLA-B*58:01, associates strongly with allopurinolinduced SCAR.The skin is often involved in ADRs and although most cutaneous ADRs have a favorable course, they may present as severe adverse cutaneous drug reactions (SCARs), such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (also referred to as drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis.By comparison, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a life-threatening severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR), mainly caused by drugs.The study sought to identify the magnitude and characteristic of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR's) like Steven-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN).Allopurinol, an antihyperuricaemic agent, is one of the common causes of life-threatening severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), including drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrosis (TEN).\"}, {\"question\": \"For what indications is thalidomide currently marketed?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Drug repositioning, exemplified by sildenafil and thalidomide, is a promising way to explore alternative indications for existing drugs.

Recently, the prognosis of POEMS was substantially improved by introduction of therapeutic intervention for myeloma. However, no randomised clinical trial has been performed because of the rarity and severity of the disease.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Japanese POEMS syndrome with Thalidomide (J-POST) Trial is a phase II/III multicentre, double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial that aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 24-week treatment with thalidomide in POEMS syndromeThalidomide could relieve clinical symptoms and intestinal mucosal lesions effectively in children with refractory inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from the pre-clinical study.In reactional states of leprosy the use of thalidomide is established.The use of thalidomide was never discontinued in Brazil where it is prescribed for leprosy type 2 reaction.New uses of thalidomide.Currently, it is used for a few indications; in Brazil, where leprosy is endemic, thalidomide is used for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum, and recent cases of thalidomide embryopathy have been reported.We analyzed the frequency of births with phenotypes consistent with thalidomide embryopathy (TEP) and correlated this with the distribution of thalidomide and the prevalence of leprosy between 2005 and 2010 in Brazil.A total of 5,889,210 thalidomide tablets were distributed; the prevalence of limb reduction defects was 1.60 (CI95%: 1.54-1.66) and TEP was 0.11 (CI95%: 0.10-0.13) per 10,000 births.The comeback of thalidomide to the legitimate status of a marketed drug came in 1998 when it received FDA approval for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL)To explore the inhibitory effect of thalidomide combined with interferon (IFN) on the human acute myeloid leukemia cell line Kasumi- 1 and its mechanism.The inhibitiory effect of Kasumi- 1 cells by thalidomide, interferon or combination was detected by CCK- 8 method, the apoptosis by flow cytometry, the expression of apoptosis related proteins by Western blot, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentration in culture supernatant by ELISA.Thalidomide inhibited the proliferation of Kasumi- 1 in a dose- dependent manner from 50 \\u03bcg/ml to 500 \\u03bcg/ml with an IC\\u2085\\u2080 of (451.Interferon (INF)-\\u03b1 was the maintenance treatment of choice after autologous stem cell transplantation in multiple myeloma in the past, but currently Thalidomide is commonly usedHowever, no randomised clinical trial has been performed because of the rarity and severity of the disease.The Japanese POEMS syndrome with Thalidomide (J-POST) Trial is a phase II/III multicentre, double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial that aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 24-week treatment with thalidomide in POEMS syndrome, with an additional 48-week open-label safety studyThalidomide, mainly used for the treatment of leprosy, is a current teratogen in South America, and it is reasonable to assume that at present this situation is affecting many births in underdeveloped countries.

Later, it was used as an investigational agent for the treatment of Hansen's disease, Kaposi's sarcoma, myelofibrosis, RAUs, and wasting associated with HIV.The drug has since been found effective for several different indications.Based on present publications we review indications of the therapy of dermatoses with thalidomide as well as possible mechanisms of action and side effects of this drug.Use of thalidomide in dermatological indications.Current data demonstrates that thalidomide is clinically promising in multiple myeloma, glioblastoma multiforme and renal cell cancer.Erythema nodosum leprosum is the only registered indication for the use of thalidomide in the United States of America.Thalidomide is currently under investigation for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases, including conditions thought to have an inflammatory or immune basis, malignancies and complications of infection with HIV.Gradually, thalidomide was reintroduced for the treatment of a few skin diseases including leprous erythema nodosum, severe mucosal ulcers (e.g., associated with HIV infection or Beh\\u00e7et's disease), lymphocytic skin infiltrations, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and chronic graft-versus-host diseaseThalidomide has been used in several cutaneous inflammatory disorders (such as erythema nodosum leprosum in lepromatous leprosy, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, severe aphtosis), cancers (relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma) and inflammatory conditions.This drug was more recently rediscovered as a powerful immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory agent and was approved by the FDA in 1998 for treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum.

Five-color FISH was performed using human DNA segments specific for peri-CEN or subTEL, which were labeled with five different fluorescent dyes [7-diethylaminocoumarin (DEAC): blue, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC): green, rhodamine 6G (R6G): yellow, TexRed: red, and cyanine5 (Cy5): purple]. Using this technique, followed by cell-by-cell multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of purified FNRBCs, we were able to detect some of the most common human aneuploidies (including Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and trisomy 13) in 33 pregnant women referred for amniocentesis.\", \"The human syndromes which can be detected with FISH are:\\n1) Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)\\n2) Genetic syndromes caused by somatic chromosomal mosaicism\\n3) Prader Willi syndrome (PWS)\\n4) Angelman syndrome (AS)\\n5) Williams syndrome\\n6) Smith Magenis syndrome \\n7) Velocardiofacial syndrome\\n8) Jacobsen syndrome\\n9) Shwachman-Diamond syndrome\\n10) Saethre-Chotzen syndrome \\n11) DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) \\n12) Velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS)\\n13) Miller-Dieker syndrome\\n14) Deletion 22q11.2 syndrome (D22S)\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"Myelodysplastic Syndrome\", \"MDS\"], [\"Genetic syndromes caused by somatic chromosomal mosaicism\"], [\"Prader Willi syndrome\", \"PWS\"], [\"Angelman syndrome\", \"AS\"], [\"Williams syndrome\"], [\"Smith Magenis syndrome\"], [\"Velocardiofacial syndrome\"], [\"Jacobsen syndrome\"], [\"Shwachman-Diamond syndrome\"], [\"Saethre-Chotzen syndrome\"], [\"DiGeorge syndrome\", \"DGS\"], [\"Velo-cardio-facial syndrome\", \"VCFS\"], [\"Miller-Dieker syndrome\"], [\"Deletion 22q11.2 syndrome\", \"D22S\"], [\"Down syndrome\", \"Trisomy 21\", \"DS\", \"DNS\"], [\"Klinefelter Syndrome\", \"47\", \"XXY\", \"KS\"], [\"Trisomy 13\", \"Patau Syndrome\"]], \"context\": \"We demonstrate that, using a sensitive FISH technique, 12p deletion occurs significantly more frequently in MDS than previously described (7.6% by CD34+ PB-FISH vs. 1.6% by CBA, P<0.001) and is often associated with other aberrations (93% by CD34+ PB-FISH vs. 60% by CBA)Somatic chromosomal mosaicism arising from post-zygotic errors is known to cause several well-defined genetic syndromes as well as contribute to phenotypic variation in diseases.The mosaicism was characterized and confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or chromosome analysis. Different categories of abnormal cell lines were detected: (1) aneuploidy, including sex chromosome abnormalities and isochromosomes (22 cases), (2) ring or marker chromosomes (12 cases), (3) single deletion/duplication copy number variations (CNVs) (11 cases), (4) multiple deletion/duplication CNVs (5 cases), (5) exonic CNVs (4 cases), and (6) unbalanced translocations (3 cases). Positive cases with MLPA technique were confirmed using either fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or follow up confirmatory MLPA probe sets.The deletions/duplications detected in non telomeric regions include regions for Prader Willi/Angelman regions, Williams syndrome, Smith Magenis syndrome and Velocardiofacial syndrome.The bone marrow specimen from a patient with MDS was comprehensively analyzed by a combination of genomic approaches, including chromosomal karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), genome scanning using Affymetrix high density SNP microarray platform, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis using IonTorrent Cancer Gene Panel.Detection of TET2 abnormalities by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 41 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.Fluorescence in situ hybridization of TP53 for the detection of chromosome 17 abnormalities in myelodysplastic syndromes.Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can effectively demonstrate TET2 deletions and is often used to validate molecular results. These findings demonstrate that 1) FISH is an effective and economical method to reveal cryptic abnormalities of band 4q22-q24 resulting in TET2 deletions;FISH and SNP-A karyotyping in myelodysplastic syndromes: improving cytogenetic detection of del(5q), monosomy 7, del(7q), trisomy 8 and del(20q). Using a standardized approach, we focused our investigation on detection of -5/del(5q), -7/del(7q), trisomy 8 and del(20q) in patients with MDS (N=52), MDS/myeloproliferative overlap syndromes (N=7) and acute myeloid leukemia (N=15) using MC, FISH and SNP-A karyotyping. We conclude that MC, FISH and SNP-A are complementary techniques that, when applied and interpreted together, can improve the diagnostic yield for identifying genetic lesions in MDS and contribute to the better description of abnormal karyotypes.Here, we report the detection of a reciprocal translocation t(7;21)(p22;q22) in the marrow of two adults with MDS and AML, using conventional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence-in situ-hybridization (FISH).Detection of cytogenetic abnormalities involving chromosomes 5,7 and 8 in myelodysplastic syndromes with fluorescence in situ hybridization and its clinical significanceTo identify the abnormal karyotypes by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and explore prognostic implications in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).FISH was used to detect the frequently occurring chromosome abnormalities (-5/5q, +8, -7/7q-) in 37 MDS cases. FISH detected monosomy 7 in 6 samples at the time MDS was diagnosed and in 2 samples at the time AA was diagnosed.As chromosomal instability may contribute to leukemogenesis in patients with congenital bone marrow failure (CBMF) disorders, it was the aim of this study to characterize chromosomally aberrant clones that arise during the clinical course of disease by means of R-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses.In one child with congenital thrombocytopenia, Jacobsen syndrome [del(11)(q24)c] was diagnosed, and thus a CBMF could be excluded. In a girl with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, two independent clones, one with an isochromosome i(7)(q10), another with a complex aberrant karyotype, were identified. Simultaneously, transition into a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) occurred. The brother, who was also afflicted with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, showed an isochromosome i(7q) as a single aberration. In summary, we suggest that follow-up of patients with CBMF using chromosome and FISH analyses will be helpful for the early detection of transition into MDS or AML and thus should be an integral part of the clinical management of these patients.Here we assess this capability by applying array CGH to the analysis of copy number alterations in 44 patients with a phenotype of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Twenty-five patients had the deletion on chromosome 22 characteristic of this syndrome as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Subtelomeric aberrations previously detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis were confirmed in two patients, and accurate diagnosis was provided in two previously undiagnosed complex cases. Microdeletions at 15q11.2-q13 in a newborn with hypotonia, cryptorchidism, and hypopigmentation were detected with few discrepancies between the array results and FISH analysis. Contiguous microdeletion of GSCL, HIRA and TBX1 genes at 22q11.2 was identified in a previously undiagnosed boy with an unusual presentation of the VCF/DiGeorge spectrum. Detection of 20q(-) chromosome abnormality in myelodysplastic syndrome by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridizationThe results showed that among 52 cases of MDS, 7 (13.5%) cases were positive by FISH, however, of which, 4 cases were positive and the other 3 cases were negative by CC assay. It is concluded that YAC912C3 and interphase FISH providing a powerful technique in the detection of 20q(-) in MDS is an important complement to CC assay.A FISH assay was performed to analyze 70 AML/MDS patients who had received conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA). FISH is a powerful tool to identify or refine chromosomal structural aberrations involving 7q, and it provides accurate evaluation of -7/7q- in all the patients. -7 and 7q- clone frequently coexist in the same specimen, and the significantly increasing percentage of 7q- cells implies that -7 clone secondary to 7q- clone is a result from loss of 7q-.Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a common craniosynostosis syndrome characterized by craniofacial and limb anomalies.We propose that initial screening for the FGFR3 P250R mutation, followed by sequencing of TWIST and then fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for deletion detection of TWIST, is sufficient to detect mutations in>80% of patients with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype.We clearly present that the use of SKY combined with conventional G-banding analysis and FISH has assisted in the identification of important chromosomal events that may play a key role in the development of t-MDS.n this study, we used spectral karyotyping (SKY) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as complementary techniques for the analysis of two therapy-related secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) cases with complex karyotypes, previously analyzed by G-banding. Comparison of detection of trisomy 8 with fluorescence in situ hybridization and conventional karyotype analysis in myelodysplastic syndromeThe trisomy 8 clones were simultaneously detected in 48 MDS cases with FISH and conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA).Trisomy 8 was detected in 1 of 15 specimens with normal or abnormal karyotype without trisomy 8 by FISH.In conclusion, our results showed that FISH is a sensitive and accurate technique to detect trisomy 8 in MDS patients. It can provide contribute to diagnosis, assessment of curative effect and predicting progress of disease in MDS. Detection of common chromosome abnormalities in myelodysplastic syndrome with a panel fluorescence in situ hybridizationPanel FISH is a useful tool of molecular cytogenetics in the detection of common chromosome abnormalities in MDS.Among 20 cases, 13 cases were found to carry common chromosome abnormalities by panel FISH (trisomy 8, five cases; -5/5q-, one case; 20q-, five cases; 5q- accompanying 20q-, one case; complex abnormalities, one case)Detection of -5/5q- chromosome abnormality in myelodysplastic syndromes by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridizationIn 48 MDS patients, 13 were positive for interphase FISH, of whom, 7 were positive and 6 were negative for conventional cytogenetics (CC).Interphase FISH is more sensitive than CC for the detection of -5/5q- in MDS.Three cases displayed -7/7q- by conventional cytogenetics(CC) and were confirmed by interphase FISH. Six cases in 43 cases who did not show -7/7q- by CC displayed -7/7q- by interphase FISH.CONCLUSION: Interphase FISH is very useful for the detection of -7 or 7q- in MDS and it is more sensitive than CC.Diagnosis of microdeletion syndromes by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).Detection of trisomy 8 with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization in myelodysplastic syndromesInterphase FISH was a useful method for the detection of trisomy 8 in MDS, especially in patients with normal karyotype or marker chromosome. Congenital cardiovascular (c-v) malformations are the leading signs of two syndromes of highly variable phenotypes, the DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) and the velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS), both of which in the majority of cases are caused by microdeletion in the chromosome region 22q11.2. In patients with congenital c-v and associated malformations of dysmorphism microdeletion diagnosis of 22q11.2 by FISH is indicated in addition to conventional cytogenetic testing. Discordant detection of monosomy 7 by GTG-banding and FISH in a patient with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome without evidence of myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myelogenous leukemia.Fluorescence in situ hybridization of progenitor cells obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for the detection of cells affected by chromosome abnormality trisomy 8 in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.We conclude that the combination of FACS/FISH/BUdR, which determines the number, phenotype and proliferation rate of very rare leukaemic cells in patients with AML or MDS in clinical remission, provides information that is useful in the identification of patients with high and low likelihood of relapse.FISH detection of chromosome 15 deletions in Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes.We conclude that FISH analysis is a rapid and reliable method for detection of deletions within 15q11-q13 and whenever a deletion is found, FISH analysis of parental chromosomes should also be considered.We have evaluated fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for the clinical laboratory detection of the 15q11-q13 deletion seen in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) using probes for loci D15S11, SNRPN, D15S10, and GABRB3. Study of clonality in myelodysplastic syndromes: detection of trisomy 8 in bone marrow cell smears by fluorescence in situ hybridization.Investigations with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrate loss of the telomeres on the reciprocal chromosome in three unbalanced translocations involving chromosome 15 in the Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes.Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used for the detection of chromosome 15(q11-13) deletions (with probes from the PWS/AS region) and to define the involvement of the telomere in the derivative chromosomes (with library probes and telomere-specific probes).Fluorescence in situ hybridization improves the detection of monosomy 7 in myelodysplastic syndromes.Detection of monosomy 7 by fluorescence in situ hybridization in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a chromosome 7 specific alpha satellite DNA probe was used to detect monosomy 7 in interphase and metaphase cells obtained from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL).A 15-year-old male with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) characterized by monosomy 7 was cytogenetically evaluated by metaphase karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of interphase cells at six different points during the course of his disease.Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using two cosmid probes (41A and P13) from the Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) critical region in 17p13.3 was performed in a blinded comparison of three MDS patients with submicroscopic deletions and in four normal relatives used as controls.These studies demonstrate that in situ hybridization is an efficient method for deletion detection in Miller-Dieker syndrome. This study identified cytogenetic abnormalities in a population screened for deletion 22q11.2 syndrome (D22S) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and G-banding and correlated these abnormalities to referring specialty and submitted indications. Positive test results for D22S FISH and other abnormalities found by other FISH assays and G-banding were correlated to submitting specialist and indicationUse of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in the diagnosis of DiGeorge sequence and related diseases.Deletions of 22q11.2 have been detected in the majority of patients with DiGeorge, velocardiofacial, and conotruncal anomaly face syndromes by either cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), or Southern blot hybridization.Fluorescence in situ hybridization improves the detection of 5q31 deletion in myelodysplastic syndromes without cytogenetic evidence of 5q-.To explore the value of multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) technique in the detection of the complex chromosomal aberrations (CCAs) in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).M-FISH was used in ten MDS patients with R-banding CCAs to refine the complex chromosomal rearrangements, the constitute of marker chromosomes, and to identify the cryptic translocations.Thirty-seven kinds of structural rearrangements were detected by M-FISH including insertion, deletion, translocation and derivative chromosomes, among which 34 kinds were unbalanced rearrangements, and 3 were balanced rearrangements including t(6;22) (q21; q12), t(9; 19) (q13; p13) and t(3;5) (?; ?).To explore the clonal evolution of monosomy 7 in patients with aplastic anemia (AA).Monosomy 7 (-7) in 81 AA patients with normal karyotype at diagnosis and 46 AA treated with immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and more than 6 months of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhuG-CSF) were detected by interphase- fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) retrospectively.There were 5.4% - 7.6% of -7 cells in 11 (13.6%) of 81 patients at diagnosis, the survival and response rate to IST in -7 positive patients did not differ significantly from that in -7 negative patients (P = 0.To compare the results of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) versus conventional cytogenetics (CC) in the detection of common chromosomal abnormalities and evaluate the significance of FISH in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) .A total of 344 patients with de novo MDS from June 2008 to October 2012 were detected by 6 pairs of probes, including CSF1R/D5S23-D5S721 (5q33) , EGR1/ D5S23-D5S721 (5q31) , D7S486 (7q31) /CSP7, D7S522 (7q31) /CSP7, D20S108/CSP8 (20q12/CSP8) and CSPX/CSPYUnbalanced translocation, t(18;21), detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in a child with 18q- syndrome and a ring chromosome 21To evaluate the conventional cytogenetic methods in genetic diagnosis and prenatal diagnosis in the family with a proband of Angelman syndrome (AS).High-resolution G-banding karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on metaphase chromosomes were performed.Two AS patients and 1 normal fetus in the family were successfully detected by FISH.Our result demonstrated that patient with type I AS could be detected by combining the techniques of high-resolution G-banding and FISH with clinical observation, which would offer accurate genetic counseling information to the geneticists and provide the prenatal diagnosis for the AS familyTo investigate the prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 syndrome using chromosome 13/21 alpha satellite probe fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on uncultured interphase cells from amniotic fluid.The interphase amniocytes of 10 fetuses who were detected normal and 3 fetus who were detected trisomy by prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis were selectedTo optimize the prenatal diagnosis platform by using domestically made fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) kit and to explore the clinical application of FISH to rapid prenatal diagnosis of a wide range of chromosomal abnormalities.Amniotic fluid samples from 110 pregnant women were studied with the rapid prenatal diagnosis method of FISH and the conventional cell culture method of karyotyping, the results from both methods were compared.Four cases of trisomy 21, 1 case of trisomy 18, 58 cases of 46, XX, and 47 cases of 46, XY were detected by FISH in the 110 amniotic fluid samples.Implementation of Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) as a method for detecting microdeletion syndromes - our first experiences.Prenatal detection of cri du chat syndrome on uncultured amniocytes using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using non-commercial probes in the diagnosis of clinically suspected microdeletion syndromes.Unbalanced translocation, t(18;21), detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in a child with 18q- syndrome and a ring chromosome 21.Using this technique, followed by cell-by-cell multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of purified FNRBCs, we were able to detect some of the most common human aneuploidies (including Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and trisomy 13) in 33 pregnant women referred for amniocentesis.FISH with 5p subtelomeric probes and 18p subtelomeric probe further confirmed that the derivative chromosome 5 has derived from a translocation between 5p and 18p, which has given rise to a 46,XY,der(5)t(5;18)(p15.1;p11.31)dn karyotype.A de novo 5p partial deletion in conjunction with a cryptic 18p duplication has been detected in a boy featuring Cri-du-Chat syndrome.We conclude that FISH is a useful, easily applied technique for the diagnosis of 22q11.2 microdeletion syndromes, particularly DGS.In group B (n=79), the 5q deletion had been observed by cytogenetics and was confirmed to be present in all cases by fluorescence in situ hybridization of 5q31.CONCLUSIONS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization of 5q31 detected the 5q deletion in 6% of cases without clear evidence of del(5q) by conventional banding cytogenetics. We suggest that fluorescence in situ hybridization of 5q31 should be performed in cases of a suspected '5q- syndrome' and/or if the cytogenetic study shows no metaphases or an aberrant karyotype with chromosome 5 involved (no 5q- chromosome).Although conventional cytogenetics is considered the gold standard to detect chromosomal abnormalities in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is being increasingly used additionally.Cytogenetic aberrations in myelodysplastic syndrome detected by comparative genomic hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization.To detect chromosomal abnormalities in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA).Comparison of high resolution chromosome banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the laboratory evaluation of Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome.Deletion of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (SNRPN) in Prader-Willi syndrome detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization: two sibs with the typical phenotype without a cytogenetic deletion in chromosome 15q.We describe two sibs with typical PWS presenting deletion of SNRPN detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).Use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in the diagnosis of DiGeorge sequence and related diseases.\"}, {\"question\": \"List symptoms of EAST syndrome.\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Epilepsy, ataxia, sensorineural deafness, and tubulopathy comprise EAST syndrome that is associated with recessive mutations in the KCNJ10 gene.\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"epilepsy\"], [\"ataxia\"], [\"sensorineural deafness\"], [\"tubulopathy\"]], \"context\": \"This condition is characterized by 4 cardinal features; Epilepsy, Ataxia, Sensorineural deafness, and (a renal salt-wasting) Tubulopathy, hence the acronym EAST syndrome.

Using Cox regression analysis, the most significant factors associated with achieving LDL cholesterol goals were lower baseline LDL cholesterol, average statin dose, and ezetimibe use. In conclusion, after maximizing statin dose, the addition of ezetimibe results in a substantial increase in the percentage of patients who reach LDL cholesterol goal, a key component of optimal medical therapy.Comparative study of bezafibrate and pravastatin in patients with coronary artery disease and high levels of remnant lipoprotein.Remnant lipoproteinemia is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) diseases. This study examined which of 2 common lipid-lowering drugs (fibrates and statins) is more effective in patients with remnant lipoproteinemia and if lowering remnant lipoprotein levels can reduce CV risk.RLP-C levels at 1 year of treatment were reduced more by bezafibrate than pravastatin (37% and 25% from baseline, respectively). Bezafibrate therapy decreased RLP-C levels to a greater extent than pravastatin and a decrease in RLP-C level may be associated with a reduction in CV events in patients with high RLP-C levels.Statins are powerful lipid-lowering drugs, widely used in patients with hyperlipidemia and coronary artery disease. Patients are frequently treated with lipid-lowering drugs such as resins, fibrates, niacin, statins and cholesterol absorption-inhibiting drugs (ezetimibe). This study sought to investigate the effect of daily glucose fluctuation on coronary plaque properties in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) pre-treated with lipid-lowering therapy.There is growing evidence that glucose fluctuation, as a residual risk apart from dyslipidemia, is an important factor contributing to the development of CAD.This prospective study enrolled 70 consecutive CAD patients who were referred for percutaneous coronary intervention and whose low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was &lt;120 mg/dl under statin treatment or &lt;100 mg/dl without statinsTo investigate the impact of lipid lowering therapy by different means on skin microvascular function in patients with dysglycaemia and coronary artery disease (CAD).Thirty-six patients were randomized to simvastatin 80 mg daily (S80, n = 19) or ezetimibe 10 mg and simvastatin 10 mg daily (E10/S10, n = 17) for 6 weeksLarge clinical trials have elucidated that lipid-lowering therapy using statins reduces cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD)The aim of the present study was to investigate whether LLT (lipid-lowering therapy) with statins could attenuate EPC telomere erosion in patients with CAD (coronary artery disease)Beneficial effects of pravastatin (+/-colestyramine/niacin) initiated immediately after a coronary event (the randomized Lipid-Coronary Artery Disease [L-CAD] Study).\"}, {\"question\": \"List drugs withdrawn from the market for cardiovascular adverse events.\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Over the years, a number of different drugs have been withdrawn for Cardiotoxicity.

Compared with other types of viral meningitis, HSV-2-meningitis is associated with a significant rate of neurological complications in the acute stage. In addition, some patients will suffer from recurrent aseptic meningitis (Mollaret's meningitis) later. We describe six patients, five women and one man, age 26-35 years, with aseptic meningitis caused by HSV-2.Viral meningitis due to echovirus types 6 and 9: epidemiological data from Western Australia.During the autumn of 1992, Western Australia experienced a large viral meningitis outbreak of dual aetiology. Echovirus 9 caused 41% of cases and occurred mainly in the metropolitan areas of Western Australia whereas echovirus 6, which caused 37% of cases, was more widespread.

The West Nile Virus (WNV) is a Flavivirus which is transmitted to man by means of different species of mosquitoes and causes outbreaks and sporadic cases of illness in different regions of the Old World, including the Mediterranean Basin.Bearing in mind the high percentage of neurological complications found to exist in the most recent outbreaks of WNV infections recorded in the Mediterranean Basin (Bucharest, Algeria), it can be thought that the WNV plays some role in the factors contributing to viral meningitis and encephalitis which occur within the population of the areas at risk within Spain.This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of aseptic meningitis caused by herpesviruses, namely herpes simplex types I and II (HSV-1, HSV-2), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV).We compared data obtained from patients with mumps meningitis and patients with aseptic meningitis caused by other viruses in order to identify mumps meningitis-specific cytokine/chemokine alterations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).METHODS: \\u2002 We elucidated the cytokine/chemokine network based on the cytokine/chemokine profiles in CSF from children with mumps meningitis and meningitis due to other viral infections using multiplex cytokine measurement.SPORADIC OCCURRENCE OF ECHO VIRUS TYPES 27 AND 31 ASSOCIATED WITH ASEPTIC MENINGITIS IN ONTARIO.Seventeen cytokines/chemokines, namely interleukin (IL)-1\\u00e2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-17, interferon (IFN)-\\u00e3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\\u00e1, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1\\u00e2 (MIP-1\\u00e2), were measured simultaneously in CSF supernatants from eight children with mumps meningitis, 11 children with other types of viral meningitis and eight children with fever without neurological complications such as convulsion.RESULTS: \\u2002 We found that IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13 and IFN-\\u00e3 showed a statistically significant increase in CSF from mumps meningitis when compared to other types of viral meningitis and fever without neurological complications.CONCLUSION: \\u2002 Mumps meningitis may induce a distinct immunological response when compared with other types of viral meningitis.We found that IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13 and IFN-\\u03b3 showed a statistically significant increase in CSF from mumps meningitis when compared to other types of viral meningitis and fever without neurological complicationsMumps meningitis may induce a distinct immunological response when compared with other types of viral meningitis.<CopyrightInformation>\\u00a9 2011 The Authors.Pediatrics International \\u00a9 2011 Japan Pediatric Society.</[Adult cases of viral meningitis caused by echovirus type 13].[Epidemic outbreak of viral meningitis caused by type 30 ECHO virus].[Outbreak of viral meningitis caused by echovirus type 4 in Misiones province].Compared with other types of viral meningitis, HSV-2-meningitis is associated with a significant rate of neurological complications in the acute stage.Seventeen cytokines/chemokines, namely interleukin (IL)-1\\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-17, interferon (IFN)-\\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\\u03b1, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1\\u03b2 (MIP-1\\u03b2), were measured simultaneously in CSF supernatants from eight children with mumps meningitis, 11 children with other types of viral meningitis aWe found that IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13 and IFN-\\u03b3 showed a statistically significant increase in CSF from mumps meningitis when compared to other types of viral meningitis and fever without neurological complications.Mumps meningitis may induce a distinct immunological response when compared with other types of viral meningitis.<CopyrightInformation>\\u00a9 2011 The Authors.Pediatrics International \\u00a9 2011 Japan Pediatric Society.</CBACKGROUND: \\u2002 The mumps virus is frequently the causative agent in aseptic meningitis and mumps has still prevailed in Japan.

The use of these drugs was also common among insulin treated diabetics but did not differ significantly from among non-diabetics. Drug use among those treated with insulin and those treated orally was substantially higher than among non-diabetics while the difference between diabetics on dietary regimen and non-diabetics was much smaller. UNLABELLED: The aims of the study were to evaluate differences in dietary, oral hygiene habits and social class in children with Type I diabetes mellitus (DM), compared to non-diabetics, and to investigate relationship between selected caries-risk factors and caries experience in diabetics. Vildagliptin is a potent and selective inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-4), orally active, that improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) primarily by enhancing pancreatic (alpha and beta) islet function.The literature covered includes original studies and meta-analyses identified in PubMed, recent abstracts presented at major diabetes scientific conferences, and clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.Although there are some differences in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of the different DPP-4 inhibitors, all are small orally active compounds with broadly similar HbA1c-lowering efficacy.The authors conclude that rosiglitazone can be safely administered with metformin and, due to the different mechanisms of action of these agents, may offer a therapeutic advantage in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.There are different classes of anti-diabetic drugs reported to treat diabetes.There are now four different classes of oral medications which are available to treat diabetes-sulfonylureas, biguanides, thiazolidinediones, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors.During followup, incident treated diabetes was defined as a self-report of a new physician diagnosis of diabetes treated with insulin or oral drugs.This systematic review will compare adherence and persistence rates across the different classes of medication available to people with type 2 diabetes.Five classes of oral hypoglycaemic drugs and two trace minerals used to treat diabetes mellitus in humans are reviewed and current knowledge on the use of these drugs in diabetic dogs and cats is presented.Sulfonylureas, biguanides, alpha-glucosidase, meglitinides, DPP-4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones are among the classes of oral hypoglycemic drugs available to treat Type II diabetes, but concerns exist regarding safety and efficacy of these drugs.Currently, four classes of orally administered antidiabetic agents are available for use in patients with type 2 diabetes: insulin secretagogues, biguanides, a-glucosidase inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones.\"}, {\"question\": \"Which pipelines are used for analyzing data from ChIP-nexus experiments?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"PeakXus and Q-nexus enable comprehensive transcription factor binding site discovery from ChIP-nexus experiments.\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"PeakXus\"], [\"Q-nexus\"]], \"context\": \"PeakXus: comprehensive transcription factor binding site discovery from ChIP-Nexus and ChIP-Exo experiments.We describe a peak caller PeakXus that is specifically designed to leverage the increased resolution of ChIP-exo/Nexus and developed with the aim of making as few assumptions of the data as possible to allow discoveries of novel binding patterns.

In multivariable analysis, high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein expression were associated with reduced breast cancer-specific survival at 10 years compared with lower concentrations (Uppsala: HR 1\\u00b762, 95% CI 1\\u00b703-2\\u00b753, p=0\\u00b7036; METABRIC: 1\\u00b727, 1\\u00b702-1\\u00b758, p=0\\u00b7034; untreated lymph node-negative cohort: 2\\u00b734, 1\\u00b724-4\\u00b742, p=0\\u00b70090; and Nottingham-HES: 1\\u00b773, 1\\u00b723-2\\u00b746, p=0\\u00b70020).

INTERPRETATION: SPAG5 is a novel amplified gene on Ch17q11.2 in breast cancer. The transcript and protein products of SPAG5 are independent prognostic and predictive biomarkers that might have clinical utility as biomarkers for combination cytotoxic chemotherapy sensitivity, especially in oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer.SPAG5 upregulation predicts poor prognosis in cervical cancer patients and alters sensitivity to taxol treatment via the mTOR signaling pathway.Previously, we found that sperm-associated antigen 5 (SPAG5) was upregulated in pelvic lymph node metastasis-positive cervical cancer.In general, SPAG5 upregulation relates to poor prognosis in cervical cancer patients, and SPAG5 is a regulator of mTOR activity during taxol treatment in cervical cancer.RESULTS: We identified novel genes whose expression was upregulated in NSCLC, including SPAG5, POLH, KIF23, and RAD54L, which are associated with mitotic spindle formation, DNA repair, chromosome segregation, and dsDNA break repair, respectively.Another module identified among male breast cancers, regulated by SPAG5, was closely associated with proliferation.In our study, SPAG5 expression in cervical cancer patients was detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry; cervical cancer cell function with downregulated SPAG5 in vitro was explored using tetrazolium assay, flow cytometry, and colony formation and Transwell assays. In patients with oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer with high SPAG5 protein expression, anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy increased breast cancer-specific survival overall compared with that for patients who did not receive chemotherapy (Nottingham-oestrogen receptor-negative-ACT cohort: HR 0\\u00b737, 95% CI 0\\u00b720-0\\u00b760, p=0\\u00b70010).We investigated the clinicopathological relevance of SPAG5 gene copy number aberrations, mRNA transcript expression, and protein expression and analysed the associations of SPAG5 copy number aberrations, transcript expression, and protein expression with breast cancer-specific survival, disease-free survival, distant relapse-free survival, pathological complete response, and residual cancer burden in the Nottingham discovery cohort, Uppsala cohort, METABRIC cohort, a pooled untreated lymph node-negative cohort (n=684), a multicentre combined cohort (n=5439), the Nottingham historical early stage breast cancer cohort (Nottingham-HES; n=1650), NIn multivariable analysis, high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein expression were associated with reduced breast cancer-specific survival at 10 years compared with lower concentrations (Uppsala: HR 1\\u00b762, 95% CI 1\\u00b703-2\\u00b753, p=0\\u00b7036; METABRIC: 1\\u00b727, 1\\u00b702-1\\u00b758, p=0\\u00b7034; untreated lymph node-negative cohort: 2\\u00b734, 1\\u00b724-4\\u00b742, p=0\\u00b70090; and Nottingham-HES: 1\\u00b773, 1\\u00b723-2\\u00b746, p=0\\u00b70020).THY1 may thus be a promising novel prognostic marker for male breast cancer. Another module identified among male breast cancers, regulated by SPAG5, was closely associated with proliferation.Furthermore, men with THY1 positive breast cancers had significantly inferior survival. THY1 may thus be a promising novel prognostic marker for male breast cancer. Another module identified among male breast cancers, regulated by SPAG5, was closely associated with proliferation.SPAG5 was recently identified as an oncogene participating in lung cancer and cervical cancer progression.SPAG5 is a novel amplified gene on Ch17q11.2 in breast cancer.Copy number aberration leading to SPAG5 gain or amplification and high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein concentrations were associated with shorter overall breast cancer-specific survival (METABRIC cohort [copy number aberration]: hazard ratio [HR] 1\\u00b750, 95% CI 1\\u00b718-1\\u00b792, p=0\\u00b700010; METABRIC cohort [transcript]: 1\\u00b768, 1\\u00b740-2\\u00b701, p<0\\u00b70001; and Nottingham-HES-breast cancer cohort [protein]: 1\\u00b768, 1\\u00b732-2\\u00b712, p<0\\u00b70001).\"}, {\"question\": \"List kinases that phosphorylates the protein Bora.\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"During cell division Bora becomes multiply phosphorylated by a variety of cell cycle kinases, including Aurora A and Plk1, and GSK3\\u03b2 and Cdk1 albeit at distinctive sites.\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"Cdk1\"], [\"Plk1\"], [\"Aurora A\"], [\"GSK3\\u03b2\"]], \"context\": \"During cell division Bora becomes multiply phosphorylated by a variety of cell cycle kinases, including Aurora A and Plk1, albeit at distinctive sites.Likewise, we find that phosphorylation of Bora by Cdk1 promotes phosphorylation of human Plk1 by Aurora A suggesting that this mechanism is conserved in humans. we show that the master mitotic kinase Cdk1 contributes to Plk1 activation through SPAT-1/Bora phosphorylationthe potential role of Bora phosphorylation by Cdk1 in this processphosphorylation of Bora on the Cdk consensus site T52 blocks Bora degradation.Here, we used the LC-MS/MS phosphopeptide mapping assay to identify 13 in vivo hBora phosphorylation sites and characterized that GSK3\\u03b2 can interact with hBora and phosphorylate hBora at Ser274 and Ser278.\"}, {\"question\": \"Which fimA genotypes are associated with disease?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"FimA has been characterized as an important virulence factor for P. gingivalis, and many studies, both animal experiments and clinical investigations, have characterized fimA genotypes II, Ib, and IV to be associated with disease (periodontitis and cardiovascular disease)\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"genotypes II\"], [\"genotypes Ib\"], [\"genotypes IV\"]], \"context\": \" FimA has been characterized as an important virulence factor for P. gingivalis, and many studies, both animal experiments and clinical investigations, have characterized fimA genotypes II, Ib, and IV to be associated with disease (periodontitis and cardiovascular disease) Long fimbriae (FimA) are important virulence factors of Porphyromonas gingivalis. Based on the diversity of the fimA gene, this species is classified into 6 genotypes.  In cases of chronic apical periodontitis, P. gingivalis variant type IV was the most prevalent (24%), followed by types I (20%), II (16%), and III (8%). In acute abscess samples, variant type II was the most prevalent (12%), followed by types III and IV (8% of each) and type I (4%).We show that P. gingivalis strains with genotype I and II of FimA are efficient in interaction with saliva or S. gordonii. A strong association between Porphyromonas gingivalis fimA genotypes II and Ib and chronic periodontitis exists in the Spanish population. The most prevalent genotype in periodontal patients is II.Our results suggest that the presence of P. gingivalis is associated with periodontal diseases, and that the type II, IV and Ib/II combination are the most common among fimA genotypes.Statistical analysis, however, revealed that a more significant correlation was found between periodontitis and the occurrence of type Ib fimA. Type II of fimA was the most prevalent genotype of P. gingivalis in patients with AgP. The population of Tregs further decreased in patients with type II FimA compared with the other types. P.gingivlias FimA genotype II was the dominant type associated with decreased Treg population. A trend toward a greater frequency of FimA II genotype in patients with moderate and severe periodontitis was determined.The fimA type Ib genotype of P. gingivalis was found to play a critical role in the destruction of peri-implant tissue, suggesting that it may be a distinct risk factor for peri-implantitis.\"}, {\"question\": \"Please list 3 diseases associated with the PIEZO2 gene.\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Recently, Gordon syndrome has been associated to heterozygous mutations in the piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2 gene (PIEZO2).

Several pipelines have been developed to specifically identify these non-linear reads and consequently predict the landscape of circRNAs based on deep sequencing datasets. Here, we use common RNAseq datasets to scrutinize and compare the output from five different algorithms; circRNA_finder, find_circ, CIRCexplorer, CIRI, and MapSplice and evaluate the levels of bona fide and false positive circRNAs based on RNase R resistance. By this approach, we observe surprisingly dramatic differences between the algorithms specifically regarding the highly expressed circRNAs and the circRNAs derived from proximal splice sites.

Analysis of the predictive role and new proposal for surgical strategies based on the modified Tomita and Tokuhashi scoring systems for spinal metastasis.We also aimed to evaluate the validity of the prognostic scores in the Tomita and Tokuhashi systems and discuss several aspects to improve the predictive accuracy of these systems. CONCLUSIONS: Tomita scores more accurately predicted survival than Tokuhashi scores. A comparison of the modified Tokuhashi and Tomita scores in determining prognosis for patients afflicted with spinal metastasis. It is for this reason that scoring systems, such as the modified Tokuhashi and Tomita scores, have been createdThe modified Tokuhashi score had better accuracy in determining actual survival.Tokuhashi, Tomita, Bauer, and Oswestry scores have been devised for survival prediction; however, none of these systems have been evaluated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).All four scoring systems could be used to prognosticate these patients. The modified Tokuhashi score is the best in doing so.Primary tumor type and Tokuhashi score independently predicted survival in patients with spinal metastases. Primary tumor type and Tokuhashi scoring independently predicted survival in patients with spinal metastases after surgery.A predictive score was then developed and compared against that of the modified Bauer score alone in terms of prognosticating 1-year survival after surgery.Our predictive score performed better than the modified Bauer alone and may be used to predict survival after surgical intervention for metastatic disease.Tokuhashi Scoring System has limited applicability in the majority of patients with spinal cord compression secondary to vertebral metastasis.Tokuhashi Scoring System has limited applicability in the majority of patients with spinal cord compression secondary to vertebral metastasisTokuhashi, Tomita, Bauer, and Oswestry scores have been devised for survival prediction; however, none of these systems have been evaluated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).To investigate the accuracy of these scoring systems in predicting survival and to identify prognostic factors for survival of the patients with spinal metastases from NPC.Retrospective analysis of the patients with spinal metastases from NPC who were treated in our institution.The study included 87 patients with spinal metastases from NPC.The primary outcome measure was the survival time of these patientsPredictive value of survival by modified Tokuhashi score was the highest among all four scoring systems.Patients with spinal metastases from NPC have relatively good survival prognosisThe data of the present study emphasize that the original Bauer score and a modified Bauer score without scoring for pathologic fracture seem to be practicable and highly predictive preoperative scoring systems for patients with spinal metastasesA retrospective study of 180 patients with lung cancer spinal metastases, wherein prognostic score-predicted survival was compared with actual survival.To evaluate and compare the accuracy of prognostic scoring systems in lung cancer spinal metastases.The modified Tokuhashi, Tomita, modified Bauer, and Oswestry scores are currently used to guide decisions regarding operative treatment of patients with spinal metastases.To evaluate the predictive values of Tokuhashi score, revised Tokuhashi score and Tomita score systems for life expectancy and treatment options in patients with spinal metastasis.A comparison of the modified Tokuhashi and Tomita scores in determining prognosis for patients afflicted with spinal metastasis.The combination of Tokuhashi score and Tomita score may be applied to better predict postoperative survival prognosis and guide the surgical options for patients with spinal metastasis..reported a composite model taking into account a modified Bauer score, preoperative albumin, and ambulatory status of patients with spinal metastasis.\"}, {\"question\": \"What are the side effects during statins administration in patients with atherosclerosis?\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"The side effects during statins administration in patients with atherosclerosis are:\\n1) Myopathy\\n2) Transaminase elevations\\n3) Diabetes mellitus \\n4) Renal and neurologic adverse effects.\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"Myopathy\"], [\"Transaminase elevations\"], [\"Diabetes mellitus\"], [\"Renal adverse effects\"], [\"Neurologic adverse effects\"]], \"context\": \"A history of side effects was reported by 40 (19.5%) of the patients, and mainly consisted of muscle complaints and gastrointestinal symptoms.

predict response to first-line medications (e.g. nicotine replacement therapy [NRT], bupropion, or varenicline) or quitting over time without a controlled treatment trial. The approval of drug combinations, such as phentermine/topiramate and bupropion/naltrexone are also noteworthy, the components of which have been previously approved, but not necessarily for obesity as main indication.Two drugs, phentermine plus topiramate and lorcaserin, have recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the indication of obesity; a third, bupropion plus naltrexone, is under consideration for approval. Bupropion SR is preferred to subjects with depression or smokers who have failed with the previous two agents, due to the many contra-indications and side effects of bupropion SR. With one of the 3 agents combined with follow-up visits with counselling, one can expect a 1-year quit rate around 20-25%.In vitro intrinsic clearances were likewise different for bupropion enantiomers.CONCLUSIONS: Stereoselective bupropion hydroxylation may have implications for the therapeutic efficacy of bupropion as an antidepressant or smoking cessation therapy, and for the use of bupropion as an in vivo phenotypic probe for CYP2B6 activity.PURPOSE: Hydroxylation of the antidepressant and smoking deterrent drug bupropion is a clinically important bioactivation and elimination pathway.Although not U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for these indications, bupropion has also been used as an adjunctive treatment to reverse antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction and to augment anti-depressant efficacy in partial responders and non-responders to other agents.Bupropion has played and will continue to play an important role as a treatment for major depressive disorder in adults, as well as for other related disordersClinically, bupropion is used as a treatment for two indications, as an antidepressant, the indication for which it was developed, and as a tobacco use cessation agentSustained release bupropion (amfebutamone) is a non-nicotine agent that is indicated as an aid to smoking cessation. Bupropion was introduced for smoking cessation following a pivotal trial showing that it gave improved efficacy over the nicotine patch and also suggesting combination treatment was beneficial.

Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the IL-4 receptor \\u03b1 subunit that blocks the signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, both key cytokines in Th2-mediated pathways.Dupilumab inhibits interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) signaling and was previously found to be effective in asthma.Data from early-stage studies suggested that interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 are requisite drivers of atopic dermatitis, evidenced by marked improvement after treatment with dupilumab, a fully-human monoclonal antibody that blocks both pathways.Background Dupilumab, a human monoclonal antibody against interleukin-4 receptor alpha, inhibits signaling of interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, type 2 cytokines that may be important drivers of atopic or allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis.The robust effects of dupilumab on skin inflammation and pruritus confirm the pathogenic role of IL-4 and IL-13 signaling in adult AD, and further support the application of Th2 cytokine antagonists in the treatment of this disease.Dupilumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-4 receptor \\u03b1 monoclonal antibody, inhibits interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signalling, key drivers of type-2-mediated inflammation.Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the IL-4 receptor \\u03b1 subunit that blocks the signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, both key cytokines in Th2-mediated pathwaysIn early-phase trials, dupilumab, a fully human mAb targeting IL-4 receptor \\ufffd, markedly improved disease activity, but the effect of IL-4/IL-13 blockade on AD at the molecular level has not been characterized.OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate dupilumab modulation of the AD molecular signature.METHODS: We performed transcriptomic analyses of pretreatment and posttreatment skin biopsy specimens from patients with moderate-to-severe AD treated weekly with 150 or 300 mg of dupilumab or placebo.RESULTS: Exacerbation of the AD transcriptome was observed in placebo-treated patients.

Cardiorenal syndromes (CRS) have been recently classified into five distinct entities, each with different major pathophysiologic mechanisms. CRS type 1 most commonly occurs in the setting of acutely decompensated heart failure where approximately 25% of patients develop a rise in serum creatinine and a reduction of urine output after the first several doses of intravenous diuretics. CRS type 2 is the hastened progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the setting of chronic heart failure. CRS type 3 is acutely decompensated heart failure after acute kidney injury from inflammatory, toxic, or ischemic insults. CRS type 4 is manifested by the acceleration of the progression of chronic heart failure in the setting of CKD. Cardiac myocyte dysfunction and fibrosis, so-called 'CKD cardiomyopathy', is believed to be the predominant pathophysiologic mechanism. Type 5 CRS is simultaneous acute cardiac and renal injury in the setting of an overwhelming systemic insult such as sepsis.

Sap1/Girdin is required for loading Cdc18/Cdc6 to origins for pre-RC assembly in the fission yeast and human cells, respectively. In eukaryotes, the pre-replication complex is composed of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), Cdc6 and the MCM replicative helicase in conjunction with Cdt1. Eukaryotic ORC is considered to be composed of six subunits, named Orc1-6, and monomeric Cdc6 is closely related in sequence to Orc1.The sequencing of the Plasmodium genome has also revealed the apparent absence of many key components (e.g. Cdt1, DDK and Cdc45) of the eukaryotic cell cycle machinery that are responsible for the formation of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC). We have characterized the Plasmodium falciparum minichromosome maintenance complex (MCM) that plays a key role in the transition of pre-RC to the RC.

Hypophosphatemia due to isolated renal phosphate wasting is a genetically heterogeneous disease. Two new genes linked to two different forms of hereditary hypophosphatemias have recently been described. Autosomal recessive form of hypophosphatemic rickets was mapped to chromosome 4q21 and identified homozygous mutations in dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) gene, which encodes a non-collagenous bone matrix protein.Somatic and germline mosaicism for a mutation of the PHEX gene can lead to genetic transmission of X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets that mimics an autosomal dominant trait.Familial hypophosphatemic rickets is usually transmitted as an X-linked dominant disorder (XLH), although autosomal dominant forms have also been observed. Genetic studies of these disorders have identified mutations in PHEX and FGF23 as the causes of X-linked dominant disorder and autosomal dominant forms, respectively.Direct nucleotide sequencing of FGF23 and PHEX revealed that the elder daughter was heterozygous for an R567X mutation in PHEX, rather than FGF23, suggesting that the genetic transmission occurred as an X-linked dominant trait. Somatic and germline mosaicism for an X-linked dominant mutation in PHEX may mimic autosomal dominant inheritance.We report two cases of x-linked dominant hypophosphatemic rickets involving a man and his daughter.

We (i) introduce a new compressed representation of a collection of genomes, which explicitly tackles the genomic variation observed at every position, and (ii) design a new alignment algorithm based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform that maps short reads from a newly sequenced genome to an arbitrary collection of two or more (up to millions of) genomes with high accuracy and no inherent bias to one specific genome.Seed-based algorithms are generally slow but robust, while Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) based algorithms are fast but less robust. To have both advantages, we developed an algorithm FANSe2 with iterative mapping strategy based on the statistics of real-world sequencing error distribution to substantially accelerate the mapping without compromising the accuracy.Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment on Parallel MapReduce (BWASW-PMR) cloud platform for long sequence alignment.In this paper, we propose a BWA-MT tool, evolved from BWA but supporting multi-thread computation, designed to fully utilize the underlying multi-core architecture of computing resources.

Palivizumab, a humanized murine monoclonal antibody that recognizes antigenic site II on both the prefusion (pre-F) and postfusion (post-F) conformations of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F glycoprotein, is the only prophylactic agent approved for use for the treatment of RSV infection.

PER2 bridges CRY and CLOCK:BMAL1 to drive the circadian negative feedback loop.<br>Two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS (for Period-Arnt-Sim) domain-containing transcriptional activators, CLOCK and BMAL1, are known to regulate gene expression by interacting with a promoter element termed the E-box (CACGTG).The CRY proteins in turn inhibit CLOCK:BMAL-mediated transcription closing the negative feedback loop.In the vertebrate circadian feedback loop, CLOCK:BMAL heterodimers induce the expression of Cry genes.Two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS (for Period-Arnt-Sim) domain-containing transcriptional activators, CLOCK and BMAL1, are known to regulate gene expression by interacting with a promoter element termed the E-box (CACGTG).In the present study, we demonstrate that Id2 is involved in stabilization of the amplitudes of the circadian oscillations by suppressing transcriptional activation of clock genes Clock and Bmal1.bmal1 is an essential transcriptional activator within the mammalian circadian clock we report here that the suprachiasmatic nucleus scn of bmal1 null mutant mice unexpectedly generates stochastic oscillations with periods that overlap the circadian range dissociated scn neurons expressed fluctuating levels of per2 detected by bioluminescence imaging but could not generate circadian oscillations intrinsically inhibition of intercellular communication or cyclic amp signaling in scn slices which provide a positive feed forward signal to drive the intracellular negative feedback loop abolished the stochastic oscillations propagation of this feed forward signal between scn neurons then promotes quasi circadian oscillations that arise as an emergent property of the scn network experimental analysis and mathematical modeling argue that both intercellular coupling and molecular noise are required for the stochastic rhythms providing a novel biological example of noise induced oscillations the emergence of stochastic circadian oscillations from the scn network in the absence of cell autonomous circadian oscillatory function highlights a previously unrecognized level of circadian organization.transcriptional regulation appears to be fundamental to circadian oscillations of clock gene expression these oscillations are believed to control output rhythms the transcriptional feedback loop and a model of interlocked loops have been proposed as the basis for these oscillations we characterized the genomic structure of the mouse bmal1 gene mbmal1 and defined the mbmal1 promoter region transcription of mbmal1 was activated by cry1 cry2 and per2 and was repressed by bmal1 clock dimers therefore cry per2 and bmal1 clock play bidirectional roles in transcription when they are at high levels by late day and midnight respectively this underlies the opposite phase of bmal1 compared to cry and per we propose that a bmal1 negative feedback loop interlocks with the cry and per2 negative feedback loop by inter activation forming a third positive forward loop this transcriptional model suggests a molecular basis for the maintenance of stability persistence and period of circadian rhythms the transcriptional potency of cry is predominant within the mammalian clock suggesting a clearance mechanism for cry in period maintenance c 2002 elsevier science usa.the circadian expression of the mammalian clock genes is based on transcriptional feedback loops two basic helix loop helix bhlh pas for period arnt sim domain containing transcriptional activators clock and bmal1 are known to regulate gene expression by interacting with a promoter element termed the e box cacgtg the non canonical e boxes or e box like sequences have also been reported to be necessary for circadian oscillation we report a new cis element required for cell autonomous circadian transcription of clock genes this new element consists of a canonical e box or a non canonical e box and an e box like sequence in tandem with the latter with a short interval 6 base pairs between them we demonstrate that both e box or e box like sequences are needed to generate cell autonomous oscillation we also verify that the spacing nucleotides with constant length between these 2 e elements are crucial for robust oscillation furthermore by in silico analysis we conclude that several clock and clock controlled genes possess a direct repeat of the e box like elements in their promoter region we propose a novel possible mechanism regulated by double e box like elements not to a single e box for circadian transcriptional oscillation the direct repeat of the e box like elements identified in this study is the minimal required element for the generation of cell autonomous transcriptional oscillation of clock and clock controlled genes.clock bmal independent circadian oscillation of zebrafish cryptochrome1a gene\"}, {\"question\": \"Which clinical trials for psoriasis involved tofacitinib?

processes in plants 1 2 there are 29 aux iaa genes in arabidopsis that exhibit unique but partially overlapping patterns of expression 3 although some studies have suggested that individual aux iaa genes have specialized function genetic analyses of the family have been limited by the scarcity of loss of function phenotypes 4 furthermore with a few exceptions our knowledge of the factors that regulate aux iaa expression is limited 1 5 we hypothesize that transcriptional control of aux iaa genes plays a central role in the establishment of the auxin signaling pathways that regulate organogenesis growth and environmental response here we describe a screen for transcription factors tfs that regulate the aux iaa genes we identify tfs from 38 families including 26 members of the dreb cbf family several dreb cbf tfs directly promote transcription of the iaa5 and iaa19 genes in response to abiotic stress recessive mutations in these iaa genes result in decreased tolerance to stress conditions demonstrating a role for auxin in abiotic stress our results demonstrate that stress pathways interact with the auxin gene regulatory network grn through transcription of the aux iaa genes we propose that the aux iaa genes function as hubs that integrate genetic and environmental information to achieve the appropriate developmental or physiological outcome.auxin is a central hormone that exerts pleiotropic effects on plant growth including the development of roots shoots flowers and fruit the perception and signaling of the plant hormone auxin rely on the cooperative action of several components among which auxin indole 3 acetic acid aux iaa proteins play a pivotal role in this study we identified and comprehensively analyzed the entire aux iaa gene family in tomato solanum lycopersicum a reference species for solanaceae plants and the model plant for fleshy fruit development functional characterization using a dedicated single cell system revealed that tomato aux iaa proteins function as active repressors of auxin dependent gene transcription with however different aux iaa members displaying varying levels of repression phylogenetic analysis indicated that the aux iaa gene family is slightly contracted in tomato compared with arabidopsis with a lower representation of non canonical proteins sl iaa genes display distinctive expression pattern in different tomato organs and tissues and some of them display differential responses to auxin and ethylene suggesting that aux iaas may play a role in linking both hormone signaling pathways the data presented here shed more light on sl iaa genes and provides new leads towards the elucidation of their function during plant development and in mediating hormone cross talk.the aux iaa genes encode a large family of short lived proteins known to regulate auxin signalling in plants functional characterization of sliaa15 a member of the tomato solanum lycopersicum aux iaa family shows that the encoded protein acts as a strong repressor of auxin dependent transcription the physiological significance of sliaa15 was addressed by a reverse genetics approach revealing that sliaa15 plays multiple roles in plant developmental processes the sliaa15 down regulated lines display lower trichome number reduced apical dominance with associated modified pattern of axillary shoot development increased lateral root formation and decreased fruit set moreover the leaves of sliaa15 inhibited plants are dark green and thick with larger pavement cells longer palisade cells and larger intercellular space of spongy mesophyll cells the sliaa15 suppressed plants exhibit a strong reduction in type i v and vi trichome formation suggesting that auxin dependent transcriptional regulation is required for trichome initiation concomitant with reduced trichome formation the expression of some r2r3 myb genes putatively involved in the control of trichome differentiation is altered these phenotypes uncover novel and specialized roles for aux iaas in plant developmental processes clearly indicating that members of the aux iaa gene family in tomato perform both overlapping and specific functions.auxins are the key players in plant growth development involving leaf formation phototropism root fruit and embryo development auxin indole 3 acetic acid aux iaa are early auxin response genes noted as transcriptional repressors in plant auxin signaling however many studies focus on aux arf gene families and much less is known about the aux iaa gene family in brassica rapa b rapa here

developed microarray data from mature leaves of chiifu and rcbr lines despite their huge morphological difference tissue specific expression analysis of briaa genes between the parental lines chiifu and rcbr showed that the genes followed a similar pattern of expression during leaf development and a different pattern during bud flower and siliqua development stages the response of the briaa genes

will significantly contribute to functional genomics of brassica crops and we belive our study would provide a foundation in understanding the aux iaa genes in b rapa.the plant hormone auxin plays a central role in regulating many aspects of plant growth and development this largely occurs as a consequence of changes in gene expression the aux iaa genes are best characterized among the early auxin responsive genes which encode short lived transcriptional repressors in most plants examined including arabidopsis soybean and rice the aux iaa genes constitute a large gene family by screening the available databases at least 15 expressed sequence tags ests have been identified from wheat triticum aestivum which exhibit high sequence identity with aux iaa homologues in other species one of these aux iaa genes taiaa1 harbouring all the four conserved domains characteristic of the aux iaa proteins has been characterized in detail the expression of taiaa1 is light sensitive tissue specific and is induced within 15 30 min of exogenous auxin application also the taiaa1 transcript levels increase in the presence of a divalent cation ca 2 and this effect is reversed by the calcium chelating agent egta the taiaa1 gene qualifies as the primary response gene because an increase in its transcript levels by auxin is unaffected by cycloheximide in addition to auxin the taiaa1 gene is also induced by brassinosteroid providing evidence that interplay between hormones is crucial for the regulation of plant growth and development.auxin regulates various aspects of plant growth and development the auxin indole 3 acetic acid aux iaa genes encode short lived transcriptional repressors that are targeted by the transport inhibitor response1 auxin receptor f box proteins the aux iaa proteins regulate auxin mediated gene expression by interacting with members of the auxin response factor protein family aux iaa function is poorly understood herein we report the identification and characterization of insertion mutants in 12 of the 29 aux iaa family members the mutants show no visible developmental defects compared with the wild type double or triple mutants of closely related aux iaa genes such as iaa8 1 iaa9 1 or iaa5 1 iaa6 1 iaa19 1 also exhibit wild type phenotypes global gene expression analysis reveals that the molecular phenotypes of auxin treated and untreated light grown seedlings are unaffected in the iaa17 6 and iaa5 1 iaa6 1 iaa19 1 mutants by contrast similar analysis with the gain of function axr3 1 iaa17 1 mutant seedlings reveals dramatic changes in basal and auxin induced gene expression compared with the wild type expression of several type a arabidopsis response regulator genes and a number of genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis and degradation is repressed in axr3 1 iaa17 1 the data suggest extensive functional redundancy among aux iaa gene family members and that enhanced stability of the axr3 iaa17 protein severely alters the molecular phenotype resulting in developmental defects.the regulatory interactions between auxin response factors arfs and aux iaa repressors play a central role in auxin signal transduction yet the systems properties of this regulatory network are not well established we generated a steroid inducible arf5 monopteros mp transgenic background to survey the involvement of this factor in the transcriptional regulation of the entire aux iaa family in arabidopsis thaliana target genes of arf5 mp identified by this approach were confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation in vitro gel retardation assays and gene expression analyses our study shows that arf5 mp is indispensable for the correct regulation of nearly one half of all aux iaa genes and that these targets coincide with distinct subclades further genetic analyses demonstrate that the protein products of multiple aux iaa targets negatively feed back onto arf5 mp activity this work indicates that arf5 mp broadly influences the expression of the aux iaa gene family and suggests that such regulation involves the activation of specific subsets of redundantly functioning factors these groups of factors may then act together to control various processes within the plant through negative feedback on arf5 similar detailed analyses of other aux iaa arf regulatory modules will be required to fully understand how auxin signal transduction influences virtually every aspect of plant growth and development.a well known physiological adaptation process of plants encountering drying soil is to achieve water balance by reducing shoot growth and maintaining or promoting root elongation but little is known about the molecular basis of this process this study investigated the role of a drought up regulated triticum aestivum nac69 1 tanac69 1 in the modulation of root growth in wheat tanac69 1 was predominantly expressed in wheat roots at the early vegetative stage overexpression of tanac69 1 in wheat roots using osrsp3 essentially root specific and ospip2 3 root predominant promoters resulted in enhanced primary seminal root length and a marked increase in maturity root biomass competitive growth analysis under water limited conditions showed that osrsp3 promoter driven tanac69 1 transgenic lines produced 32 and 35 more above ground biomass and grains than wild type plants respectively tanac69 1 overexpression in the roots down regulated the expression of tashy2 and taiaa7 which are from the auxin iaa aux iaa transcriptional repressor gene family and are the homologs of negative root growth regulators shy2 iaa3 and iaa7 in arabidopsis the expression of tashy2 and taiaa7 in roots was down regulated by drought stress and up regulated by cytokinin treatment which inhibited root growth dna binding and transient expression analyses revealed that tanac69 1 bound to the promoters of tashy2 and taiaa7 acted as a transcriptional repressor and repressed the expression of reporter genes driven by the tashy2 or taiaa7 promoter these data suggest that tanac69 1 is a transcriptional repressor of tashy2 and taiaa7 homologous to arabidopsis negative root growth regulators and is likely to be involved in promoting root elongation in drying soil.auxin mediates numerous plant responses some of which have been shown to require transcriptional regulation one auxin response pathway which depends on the relief of transcriptional repression is mediated by tir1 transport inhibitor response protein 1 tir1 is an auxin receptor and also a subunit of an scf type ubiquitin ligase in the presence of a low concentration of auxin in the nucleus members of the aux iaa family of transcriptional repressors bind to arf proteins and inhibit the transcription of specific auxin response genes increased nuclear concentrations of auxin promote auxin binding to tir1 causing the aux iaa proteins to associate with tir1 and leading to their degradation by a proteasome mediated pathway this decreases the concentration of aux iaa proteins in the nucleus and thereby enables the expression of certain auxin response genes.recent studies of auxin response have focused on the functions of three sets of proteins the auxin aux response factors arfs the aux iaas and the f box protein tir1 the arf proteins bind dna and directly activate or repress transcription of target genes while the aux iaa proteins repress arf function tir1 is part of a ubiquitin protein ligase required for degradation of aux iaa proteins here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel mutant of arabidopsis called axr5 1 mutant plants are resistant to auxin and display a variety of auxin related growth defects including defects in root and shoot tropisms further the axr5 1 mutation results in a decrease in auxin regulated transcription the molecular cloning of axr5 revealed that the gene encodes the iaa1 protein a member of the aux iaa family of proteins axr5 is expressed throughout plant development consistent with the pleiotropic mutant phenotype the axr5 1 mutation results in an amino acid substitution in conserved domain ii of the protein similar to gain of function mutations recovered in other members of this gene family biochemical studies show that iaa1 axr5 interacts with tir1 in an auxin dependent manner the mutation prevents this interaction suggesting that the mutant phenotype is caused by the accumulation of iaa1 axr5 our results provide further support for a model in which most members of the aux iaa family are targeted for degradation by scftir1 in response to auxin.\"}, {\"question\": \"List the ten types of conjoined twins.\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Thoraco-omphalopagus: Two bodies fused from the upper chest to the lower chest.

These data have led to the detection of characteristic patterns of somatic mutations or \\\"mutation signatures\\\" at an unprecedented resolution, with the potential for new insights into the causes and mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Here we present new methods for modelling, identifying and visualizing such mutation signatures. Our methods greatly simplify mutation signature models compared with existing approaches, reducing the number of parameters by orders of magnitude even while increasing the contextual factors (e.g. the number of flanking bases) that are accounted for. This improves both sensitivity and robustness of inferred signatures. We also provide a new intuitive way to visualize the signatures, analogous to the use of sequence logos to visualize transcription factor binding sites. We illustrate our new method on somatic mutation data from urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract, and a larger dataset from 30 diverse cancer types. The results illustrate several important features of our methods, including the ability of our new visualization tool to clearly highlight the key features of each signature, the improved robustness of signature inferences from small sample sizes, and more detailed inference of signature characteristics such as strand biases and sequence context effects at the base two positions 5' to the mutated site. The overall framework of our work is based on probabilistic models that are closely connected with \\\"mixed-membership models\\\" which are widely used in population genetic admixture analysis, and in machine learning for document clustering. We argue that recognizing these relationships should help improve understanding of mutation signature extraction problems, and suggests ways to further improve the statistical methods.

The components are abdominal obesity, impaired glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.MetS is recognized clinically by numerous constitutive traits, including abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and hyperglycemia. Abdominal obesity is frequently associated with a collection of metabolic disorders that include elevated blood pressure, characteristic lipid abnormalities (low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high triglycerides) and increased fasting glucose, with an underlying situation of insulin resistance, which has been defined as metabolic syndromeThe presence of 3 or more of the following 5 components (abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertension and high fasting blood glucose) allows to diagnose metabolic syndrome.The metabolic syndrome has 5 criteria: central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, fasting hyperglycemia, and hypertension.Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of interrelated risk factors of metabolic origin including abdominal obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, elevated plasma glucose level, and prothrombotic and proinflammatory states that promote atherosclerotic CVD and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.The waist circumference cut points for diagnosing metabolic syndrome (as defined using the new harmonised guidelines), insulin resistance, dysglycaemia, hypertension and dyslipidaemia were obtained using receiver operator characteristic curve analysis.The metabolic syndrome is a complex association of several risk factors including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and essential hypertension.  insulin resistance syndrome (often referred to as syndrome X or the metabolic syndrome) ie, a clustering of metabolic, atheromatous risk factors, including hypertriglyceridaemia, hyperinsulinaemia, hyper-tension, hypercholesterinaemia and obesity.

Contemporary clinical ethics was founded on principlism, and the four principles: respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence and justice, remain dominant in medical ethics discourse and practice.Each of the four principles (beneficence, nonmaleficence,justice and autonomy) is investigated in turn, looking in particular at the extent to which each is rooted in the Islamic paradigm.Guided by the medical ethics principles of \\\"four principles plus scope,\\\" Chinese aesthetic medical practitioners have proposed some extremely valuable ethical principles combined with the construction of aesthetic medicine and the requirements of clinical practice such as the principle of general nonmaleficence, the principle of local minimal invasiveness, the principle of informed consent, and the principle of respect and confidentiality.This commentary briefly argues that the four prima facie principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, respect for autonomy and justice enable a clinician (and anybody else) to make ethical sense of the author's proposed reliance on professional guidance and rules, on law, on professional integrity and on best interests, and to subject them all to ethical analysis and criticism based on widely acceptable basic prima facie moral obligations; and also to confront new situations in the light of those acceptable principles.BACKGROUND: The four principles of Beauchamp and Childress--autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice--have been extremely influential in the field of medical ethics, and are fundamental for understanding the current approach to ethical assessment in health care. Difficulties with the application of the four principles (autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and justice) to judge medical practitioner behaviour are highlighted. Tom Beauchamp and James Childress have always maintained that their four principles approach (otherwise known as principlism) is a globally applicable framework for biomedical ethics. This claim is grounded in their belief that the principles of respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice form part of a 'common morality', or collection of very general norms to which everyone who is committed to morality subscribes.I will argue that there are difficulties with the application of the four principles approach to incompetent children. The most important principle - respect for autonomy - is not directly applicable to incompetent children and the most appropriate modification of the principle for them is not clear. The principle of beneficence - that one should act in the child's interests - is complicated by difficulties in assessing what a child's interests are and to which standard of interests those choosing for children should be held.These principles are: respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice, along with concern for their scope of application.BACKGROUND: The four principles of Beauchamp and Childress--autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice--have been extremely influential in the field of medical ethics, and are fundamental for understanding the current approach to ethical assessment in health care.Difficulties with the application of the four principles (autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and justice) to judge medical practitioner behaviour are highlighted.Four main principles underlie medical ethics: autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice.This approach to treatment is discussed in the context of the four principles of medical ethics, namely respect for autonomy, justice, beneficence and non-maleficence.\"}, {\"question\": \"List symptoms of Heerfordt syndrome.\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Heerfordt syndrome (also known as Heerfordt-Waldenstr\\u00f6m or uveoparotid fever)  is a rare presentation of sarcoidosis characterized by the presence of parotid gland enlargement, facial palsy, anterior uveitis, and fever.\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"parotid gland enlargement\"], [\"facial palsy\"], [\"anterior uveitis\"], [\"fever\"]], \"context\": \"Case 3 showed Heerfordt syndrome with facial nerve paralysis.Heerfordt's syndrome is defined as a combination of facial palsy, parotid swelling, uveitis and fever in sarcoidosis cases.Heerfordt-Waldenstr\\u00f6m syndrome, a rare presentation of sarcoidosis, is characterized by the presence of parotid gland enlargement, facial palsy, anterior uveitis, and fever.

These chondromas were possibly components of Carney's triad, because each nodule had a thin fibrous pseudocapsule and did not have an entrapped epithelium and fat.A curious association of three rare tumours was described by Carney in 1977.

No chondromas were detected. An incomplete Carney's Triad was diagnosed. Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) occur mostly as sporadic solitary lesions involving the tubular GI tract and are only rarely associated with other benign or malignant neoplasms or occur as part of a multi-neoplastic disease as in the setting of Carney's triad and von Recklinghausen's disease.Carney's triad is a very unusual syndrome, associating three different tumours on the same patient, a young woman generally: a gastric leiomyoblastoma, a pulmonary chondroma and an extra-adrenal paraganglioma. This report encourages clinicians to consider a diagnosis of Carney's triad in patients with multifocal gastric stromal sarcoma, extraadrenal paraganglioma (predominantly mediastinal), or pulmonary chondroma.Carney's triad represents the association of gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor, pulmonary chondroma, and extraadrenal paraganglioma.Thus, the Triad may be a disorder of the autonomic nervous system rather than a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome or multiple hamartoma syndrome.Carney's triad is a syndrome of unknown etiology, representing a combination of gastrointestinal stromal tumors, bronchial chondromas and vagal, adrenal or paraadrenal paragangliomas.Two of the Carney's triad components-the paragangliomas and the gastrointestinal stromal tumors-are potentially lethal.Carney's triad, a rare disorder affecting young females, is characterized by the presence of at least two of the three following neoplasms: gastric epithelioid leiomyosarcoma, extra-adrenal paraganglioma, and pulmonary chondroma.Carney's triad--gastric leiomyosarcoma, pulmonary chondroma, and extra-adrenal paraganglioma--is a syndrome that occurs primarily in young women.We communicate a case with the Carney triad (gastric leiomyosarcoma, pulmonary chondromatosis and extra-adrenal paraganglioma).The etiology of the Carney's triad (gastrointestinal stromal tumors, pulmonary chondromas, and paragangliomas) is unknown, and only 57 cases have been reported since its identification in 1977.Carney's triad is defined by the coexistence of at least two of three rare disorders, including gastric epithelioid leiomyosarcoma (malignant leiomyoblastoma), pulmonary chondroma, and paraganglioma, most often extra-adrenal and functioning.\"}, {\"question\": \"List 3 symptoms of Wernicke encephalopathy.\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is a neurological syndrome caused by thiamine deficiency, and clinically characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and acute confusion.\", \"Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is a neurological syndrome caused by thiamine deficiency, and clinically characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and acute confusion. \"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"ophthalmoplegia\"], [\"ataxia\"], [\"acute confusion\"]], \"context\": \"Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is a neurological syndrome caused by thiamine deficiency, and clinically characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and acute confusion. entire triad of classic features of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome: confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia or nystagmus.

In this work we propose a new reference-based compressor for SAM files, which can accommodate different levels of compression, based on the specific needs of the user. In particular, the proposed compressor GeneComp allows the user to perform lossy compression of the quality scores, which have been proven to occupy more than half of the compressed file (when losslessly compressed). We show that the proposed compressor GeneComp overall achieves better compression ratios than previously proposed algorithms when working on lossless mode.The enormous size of these data motivates the development of data compression algorithms usable for the implementation of the various storage policies that are applied to the produced intermediate and final result files. In this article, we present NGC, a tool for the compression of mapped short read data stored in the wide-spread SAM format. NGC enables lossless and lossy compression and introduces the following two novel ideas: first, we present a way to reduce the number of required code words by exploiting common features of reads mapped to the same genomic positions; second, we present a highly configurable way for the quantization of per-base quality values, which takes their influence on downstream analyses into account. NGC, evaluated with several real-world data sets, saves 33-66% of disc space using lossless and up to 98% disc space using lossy compression. By applying two popular variant and genotype prediction tools to the decompressed data, we could show that the lossy compression modes preserve>99% of all called variants while outperforming comparable methods in some configurations.Research in bioinformatics primarily involves collection and analysis of a large volume of genomic data. Naturally, it demands efficient storage and transfer of this huge amount of data. In recent years, some research has been done to find efficient compression algorithms to reduce the size of various sequencing data. One way to improve the transmission time of large files is to apply a maximum lossless compression on them. In this paper, we present SAMZIP, a specialized encoding scheme, for sequence alignment data in SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format, which improves the compression ratio of existing compression tools available.Recent advancements in sequencing technology have led to a drastic reduction in the cost of sequencing a genome. This has generated an unprecedented amount of genomic data that must be stored, processed and transmitted. To facilitate this effort, we propose a new lossy compressor for the quality values presented in genomic data files (e.g. FASTQ and SAM files), which comprise roughly half of the storage space (in the uncompressed domain). Lossy compression allows for compression of data beyond its lossless limit.RESULTS: The proposed algorithm QVZ exhibits better rate-distortion performance than the previously proposed algorithms, for several distortion metrics and for the lossless case. Moreover, it allows the user to define any quasi-convex distortion function to be minimized, a feature not supported by the previous algorithms. Finally, we show that QVZ-compressed data exhibit better performance in the genotyping than data compressed with previously proposed algorithms, in the sense that for a similar rate, a genotyping closer to that achieved with the original quality values is obtained.In this paper, we present SAMZIP, a specialized encoding scheme, for sequence alignment data in SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format, which improves the compression ratio of existing compression tools available.We describe CSAM (Compressed SAM format), a compression approach offering lossless and lossy compression for SAM files.GeneComp, a new reference-based compressor for SAM files.\"}, {\"question\": \"List 4 drugs used to treat opioid addiction or overdose\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"Suboxone (buprenorphine/naloxone) and  methadone are used to assist in opioid withdrawal and Naloxone is used to treat overdoses\"], \"exact_answer\": [[\"methadone\"], [\"naloxone\"], [\"suboxone\"], [\"buprenorphine\"]], \"context\": \"Currently, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends methadone, buprenorphine, or buprenorphine/naloxone in the treatment of prenatal opioid abuse.PubMed was searched and literature was reviewed on the effectiveness, safety, and side effect profiles of abstinence-based treatment, buprenorphine-naloxone treatment, and methadone treatment.Methadone is an opioid prescribed for pain management and is also provided through opioid treatment programs to treat opioid use disorders.Fortunately, there are effective medications (ie, methadone, buprenorphine, and oral and injectable naltrexone) available for the treatment of opioid addiction.

LEM-3 acts at the midbody, the structure where abscission occurs at the end of cytokinesis. LEM-3 localization depends on factors needed for midbody assembly, and LEM-3 accumulation is increased and prolonged when chromatin bridges are trapped at the cleavage plane. LEM-3 locally processes chromatin bridges that arise from incomplete DNA replication, unresolved recombination intermediates, or the perturbance of chromosome structure. Proper LEM-3 midbody localization and function is regulated by AIR-2/Aurora B kinase. Strikingly, LEM-3 acts cooperatively with the BRC-1/BRCA1 homologous recombination factor to promote genome integrity. These findings provide a molecular basis for the suspected role of the LEM-3 orthologue Ankle1 in human breast cancer.The conserved LEM-3/Ankle1 nuclease is involved in the combinatorial regulation of meiotic recombination repair and chromosome segregation in Caenorhabditis elegans.Here we show that the LEM-3 nuclease, mutation of which by itself does not have an overt meiotic phenotype, genetically interacts with slx-1 and mus-81 mutants, the respective double mutants displaying 100% embryonic lethality. The combined loss of LEM-3 and MUS-81 leads to altered processing of recombination intermediates, a delayed disassembly of foci associated with CO designated sites, and the formation of univalents linked by SPO-11 dependent chromatin bridges (dissociated bivalents). However, LEM-3 foci do not colocalize with ZHP-3, a marker that congresses into CO designated sites. In addition, neither CO frequency nor distribution is altered in lem-3 single mutants or in combination with mus-81 or slx-4 mutations. Finally, we found persistent chromatin bridges during meiotic divisions in lem-3; slx-4 double mutants. Supported by the localization of LEM-3 between dividing meiotic nuclei, this data suggest that LEM-3 is able to process erroneous recombination intermediates that persist into the second meiotic division.LEM-3 - A LEM domain containing nuclease involved in the DNA damage response in C. elegans.Strikingly, LEM-3 acts cooperatively with the BRC-1/BRCA1 homologous recombination factor to promote genome integrity.LEM-3 locally processes chromatin bridges that arise from incomplete DNA replication, unresolved recombination intermediates, or the perturbance of chromosome structure.Using C. elegans embryos we show that the LEM-3/Ankle1 nuclease defines a previously undescribed genome integrity mechanism by processing DNA bridges right before cells divide.LEM-3 acts at the midbody, the structure where abscission occurs at the end of cytokinesis.\"}, {\"question\": \"List uniparental disomy (UPD) detection algorithms\", \"ideal_answer\": [\"UPDtool and AsCNAR are tools for detecting uniparental disomy (UPD).

If a read maps at different positions, the tool detects that the corresponding genes are duplicated; it merges the genes and creates a merged gene. The counts of ambiguous reads is then based on the input genes and the merged genes.CONCLUSION: mmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools htseq-count and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way.Allele-specific expression (ASE) refers to the differential abundance of the allelic copies of a transcript. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can provide quantitative estimates of ASE for genes with transcribed polymorphisms. When short-read sequences are aligned to a diploid transcriptome, read-mapping ambiguities confound our ability to directly count reads. Multi-mapping reads aligning equally well to multiple genomic locations, isoforms or alleles can comprise the majority (>85%) of reads. Discarding them can result in biases and substantial loss of information.

It can deal with more than two APA sites in a gene as well as APA sites that occur before the last exon. The tool is based on an existing method for finding change points in time series data, but some filtration techniques are also adopted to remove change points that are likely false APA sites. It is then extended to identify APA sites that are expressed differently between two biological samples and genes that contain 3' UTRs with shortening/lengthening events. Our extensive experiments on simulated and real RNA-Seq data demonstrate that TAPAS outperforms the existing tools for APA site detection or shortening/lengthening analysis significantly.PlantAPA: A Portal for Visualization and Analysis of Alternative Polyadenylation in Plants.Increasing numbers of poly(A) sites collected in various plant species demand new methods and tools to access and mine these data. We have created an open-access web service called PlantAPA (http://bmi.xmu.edu.cn/plantapa) to visualize and analyze genome-wide poly(A) sites in plants. PlantAPA provides various interactive and dynamic graphics and seamlessly integrates a genome browser that can profile heterogeneous cleavage sites and quantify expression patterns of poly(A) sites across different conditions. Particularly, through PlantAPA, users can analyze poly(A) sites in extended 3' UTR regions, intergenic regions, and ambiguous regions owing to alternative transcription or RNA processing. In addition, it also provides tools for analyzing poly(A) site selections, 3' UTR lengthening or shortening, non-canonical APA site switching, and differential gene expression between conditions, making it more powerful for the study of APA-mediated gene expression regulation. More importantly, PlantAPA offers a bioinformatics pipeline that allows users to upload their own short reads or ESTs for poly(A) site extraction, enabling users to further explore poly(A) site selection using stored PlantAPA poly(A) sites together with their own poly(A) site datasets. To date, PlantAPA hosts the largest database of APA sites in plants, including Oryza sativa, Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. As a user-friendly web service, PlantAPA will be a valuable addition to the community of biologists studying APA mechanisms and gene expression regulation in plants.In our recent RNA-seq experiments using cells with hyper-activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), we found that cellular mTOR activation leads to transcriptome-wide alternative polyadenylation (APA), resulting in the activation of multiple cellular pathways. Here, we developed a novel bioinformatics algorithm, IntMAP, which integrates RNA-Seq and PolyA Site (PAS)-Seq data for a comprehensive characterization of APA events. By applying IntMAP to the datasets from cells with hyper-activated mTOR, we identified novel APA events that could otherwise not be identified by either profiling method alone. Several transcription factors including Cebpg (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein gamma) were among the newly discovered APA transcripts, indicating that diverse transcriptional networks may be regulated by mTOR-coordinated APA. The prevention of APA in Cebpg using the CRISPR/cas9-mediated genome editing tool showed that mTOR-driven 3'-UTR shortening in Cebpg is critical in protecting cells from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Taken together, we present IntMAP as a new bioinformatics algorithm for APA analysis by which we expand our understanding of the physiological role of mTOR-coordinated APA events to ER stress response.

              " 'Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a cellular process by which some forms of DNA damage are repaired more rapidly from transcribed strands of active genes than from nontranscribed strands or the overall genome. In humans, the TCR coupling factor, CSB, plays a critical role in restoring transcription following both UV-induced and oxidative DNA damage. It also contributes indirectly to the global repair of some forms of oxidative DNA damage. The Escherichia coli homolog, Mfd, is similarly required for TCR of UV-induced lesions.Transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) is involved in correcting UV-induced damage and other road-blocks encountered in the transcribed strand. Mutation frequency decline (Mfd) is a transcription repair coupling factor, involved in repair of template strand during transcription.the transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, promotes direct restart of the fork following the collision by facilitating displacement of the RNAP.We report observations suggesting that the transcription elongation factor NusA promotes a previously unrecognized class of transcription-coupled repair (TCR) in addition to its previously proposed role in recruiting translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases to gaps encountered during transcription.NusA participates in an alternative class of TCR involved in the identification and removal of a class of lesion, such as the N(2)-f-dG lesionBacterial transcription-coupled repair is initiated when RNA polymerase stalled at a DNA lesion is removed by Mfd, an ATP-dependent DNA translocase.Transcription-coupled repair, the targeted repair of the transcribed strands of active genes, is defective in bacteria, yeast, and human cells carrying mutations in mfd, RAD26 and ERCC6, respectively.The effect of the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, at such lesions is not known: it has been suggested that Mfd may promote mutagenesis by increasing the efficiency with which RNA polymerase bypasses non-bulky lesions, but it has also been reported that 8-oxoguanine, a major product of oxidative DNA damage that is efficiently bypassed by RNA polymerase, is subject to Mfd-dependent transcription-coupled repair in Escherichia coli.The transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF, the product of the mfd gene) is a widely conserved bacterial protein that mediates transcription-coupled DNA repair.Recent structural studies of the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, have revealed a modular architecture in which an ATP-dependent DNA-based motor is coupled to protein-protein interaction domains that can attach the motor to RNA polymerase and the DNA repair protein UvrA.The bacterial Mfd protein is a transcription-repair coupling factor that performs two key functions during transcription-coupled DNA repair.Mfd remains bound to the DNA in a long-lived complex that could act as a marker for sites of DNA damage, directing assembly of subsequent DNA repair factors.Transcription and DNA repair are coupled in E. coli by the Mfd protein, which dissociates transcription elongation complexes blocked at nonpairing lesions and mediates recruitment of DNA repair proteins.The first is to remove RNA polymerase (RNAP) complexes that have been stalled by a DNA lesion from the site of damage, and the second is to mediate the recruitment of DNA repair proteins.Coupling of transcription and DNA repair in bacteria is mediated by transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF, the product of the mfd gene), which removes transcription elongation complexes stalled at DNA lesions and recruits the nucleotide excision repair machinery to the site.Mfd remains bound to the DNA in a long-lived complex that could act as a marker for sites of DNA damage, directing assembly of subsequent DNA repair factorsMfd may act through a translocase activity that rewinds upstream DNA, leading either to translocation or to release of RNA polymerase when the enzyme active site cannot continue elongation.Recent structural studies of the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, have revealed a modular architecture in which an ATP-dependent DNA-based motor is coupled to protein-protein interaction domains that can attach the motor to RNA polymerase and the DNA repair protein UvrAE. coli Transcription repair coupling factor (Mfd protein) rescues arrested complexes by promoting forward translocation.We also find that the transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, promotes direct restart of the fork following the collision by facilitating displacement of the RNAPWe also found that the transcription-repair coupling factor Mfd promotes direct restart of the fork after the collision by facilitating displacement of the RNAPWe show that Mfd-dependent TCR in bacteria involves the formation of a damage search complex that can detect lesions downstream of a stalled RNAP, and that the strand specificity of the accelerated repair pathway is independent of the requirement for a lesion to stall RNAPcoli by the Mfd protein, which dissociates transcription elongation complexes blocked at nonpairing lesions and mediates recruitment of DNA repair proteins')"

              "{'context': 'Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a cellular process by which some forms of DNA damage are repaired more rapidly from transcribed strands of active genes than from nontranscribed strands or the overall genome. In humans, the TCR coupling factor, CSB, plays a critical role in restoring transcription following both UV-induced and oxidative DNA damage. It also contributes indirectly to the global repair of some forms of oxidative DNA damage. The Escherichia coli homolog, Mfd, is similarly required for TCR of UV-induced lesions.Transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) is involved in correcting UV-induced damage and other road-blocks encountered in the transcribed strand. Mutation frequency decline (Mfd) is a transcription repair coupling factor, involved in repair of template strand during transcription.the transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, promotes direct restart of the fork following the collision by facilitating displacement of the RNAP.We report observations suggesting that the transcription elongation factor NusA promotes a previously unrecognized class of transcription-coupled repair (TCR) in addition to its previously proposed role in recruiting translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases to gaps encountered during transcription.NusA participates in an alternative class of TCR involved in the identification and removal of a class of lesion, such as the N(2)-f-dG lesionBacterial transcription-coupled repair is initiated when RNA polymerase stalled at a DNA lesion is removed by Mfd, an ATP-dependent DNA translocase.Transcription-coupled repair, the targeted repair of the transcribed strands of active genes, is defective in bacteria, yeast, and human cells carrying mutations in mfd, RAD26 and ERCC6, respectively.The effect of the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, at such lesions is not known: it has been suggested that Mfd may promote mutagenesis by increasing the efficiency with which RNA polymerase bypasses non-bulky lesions, but it has also been reported that 8-oxoguanine, a major product of oxidative DNA damage that is efficiently bypassed by RNA polymerase, is subject to Mfd-dependent transcription-coupled repair in Escherichia coli.The transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF, the product of the mfd gene) is a widely conserved bacterial protein that mediates transcription-coupled DNA repair.Recent structural studies of the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, have revealed a modular architecture in which an ATP-dependent DNA-based motor is coupled to protein-protein interaction domains that can attach the motor to RNA polymerase and the DNA repair protein UvrA.The bacterial Mfd protein is a transcription-repair coupling factor that performs two key functions during transcription-coupled DNA repair.Mfd remains bound to the DNA in a long-lived complex that could act as a marker for sites of DNA damage, directing assembly of subsequent DNA repair factors.Transcription and DNA repair are coupled in E. coli by the Mfd protein, which dissociates transcription elongation complexes blocked at nonpairing lesions and mediates recruitment of DNA repair proteins.The first is to remove RNA polymerase (RNAP) complexes that have been stalled by a DNA lesion from the site of damage, and the second is to mediate the recruitment of DNA repair proteins.Coupling of transcription and DNA repair in bacteria is mediated by transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF, the product of the mfd gene), which removes transcription elongation complexes stalled at DNA lesions and recruits the nucleotide excision repair machinery to the site.Mfd remains bound to the DNA in a long-lived complex that could act as a marker for sites of DNA damage, directing assembly of subsequent DNA repair factorsMfd may act through a translocase activity that rewinds upstream DNA, leading either to translocation or to release of RNA polymerase when the enzyme active site cannot continue elongation.Recent structural studies of the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, have revealed a modular architecture in which an ATP-dependent DNA-based motor is coupled to protein-protein interaction domains that can attach the motor to RNA polymerase and the DNA repair protein UvrAE. coli Transcription repair coupling factor (Mfd protein) rescues arrested complexes by promoting forward translocation.We also find that the transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, promotes direct restart of the fork following the collision by facilitating displacement of the RNAPWe also found that the transcription-repair coupling factor Mfd promotes direct restart of the fork after the collision by facilitating displacement of the RNAPWe show that Mfd-dependent TCR in bacteria involves the formation of a damage search complex that can detect lesions downstream of a stalled RNAP, and that the strand specificity of the accelerated repair pathway is independent of the requirement for a lesion to stall RNAPcoli by the Mfd protein, which dissociates transcription elongation complexes blocked at nonpairing lesions and mediates recruitment of DNA repair proteins',\n",
